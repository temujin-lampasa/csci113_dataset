I have a meeting in there later this afternoon and thought I'd call to find out when they were picking up their catering supplies. The guy said I'll call you back tomorrow and I told him I have a meeting this afternoon and just wanted to know when they were coming back for their items. He said ""hold on"" and that was 22 minutes ago. I still waiting on my headset, but although I can hear him talking to people in the background he won't get back on the phone with me.

I am someone who frequently utilizes caterers for large functions at work. This lack of respect for a potential customer has lost them quite a bit of business since people were saying they liked their food and we should use them. I'll let everyone know that will not be the case. And I'll let other coordinators here know my experience so they don't make the mistake of using them either.",2016-11-09 21:25:50

In addition, the crew was super rude right tin front of the customers.  Chatting about inappropriate things among themselves, talking on the phone, eating in the front end register area, etc...

Last time, it was the same scenario with the total lack of professionalism AND a young employee had gone outside to smoke a cigarette right in front of ht front door of the restaurant resting alongside the fence to the kid's playground where my children were playing!

I tried the Mega Bowl tonight, good flavour overall on all 3 items and price point of just over $10 after tax was okay considering the location. What lost 2 stars for my own tastes were: picture did look fuller; rice was softer than I would have liked in that the morsels were not singular but rather smooshed together; and lastly the tempura batter was lacking texturally - more oily and dense vs. light and crisp.

EDIT - FEB 1, 2018 - It happened again.  I ordered three junior hamburgers (NOT cheeseburgers) and a large fries at the drive-thru.  The order-taker repeated my order for accuracy.  I get up to the window, get my order, and discover the fries are rather overcooked.  I was given replacement fries, but was made to wait until two other customers had received their fries & sandwiches.  The replacement fries were on the edge of being overcooked.  Then, upon arriving back home, I discovered I had received cheeseburgers.  AGAIN.  FOR THE 4TH TIME THIS MONTH.  Each time I ordered hamburgers.  Each time I received cheeseburgers.  How hard is it to tell the difference?  I hope the franchise manager is reading this - I've written a complaint to Wendy's corporate too.

This was just going to be about the fries.  Then, I got home, and saw my burgers.

I ordered four junior hamburgers, ketchup/mustard only on each of them.  I saw my order accurately listed on the display by the drive-thru menu.  I get home to discover I have four cheeseburgers.  For me, that's not good - I've never cared for the cheese @ Wendy's, just a personal preference.  The cheeseburger thing has happened twice now.

The fries - for the 5th visit in a row, the fries were near inedible.  I'm not sure if they're always overcooked, just sitting around too long, or a combination of the two.  It seems I can't get fresh fries unless I visit during the peak of lunch rush.

All of that is a shame - Wendy's is my preferred fast food burger chain, and this is the location closest to my house.  But if my orders keep getting screwed up, why should I come back?",2018-02-01 19:14:02

While nothing particularly special, they certainly are a cut above ""blandly generic.""  The fact that they keep hot sauces (Get it?!  FIRE-house?!  HOT!!!  oh ho ho) on the counter is an added bonus.

I suppose the mitigating factor is that I could just as easily traverse to a grocery store, purchase meat, make a sandwich, and have it come out just as good, if not better.  And therein lies the problem, though this really is an issue for me with any sandwich location, and thusly why you may see this review repeated throughout the various sandwich shop locales I post on.",2008-04-29 21:37:04

My friends and I had just finished playing in a dodgeball tournament at OSU and were hungry, so we went for a bite to eat. It was ""rush hour"" in the restaurant world and every place was packed, with the exception of good ol' Cluck-u-chicken. Literally, there was nobody there (this was warning sign number 1). Completely ignoring the fact that nobody was eating there and there were flies everywhere in the restaurant, we decided to go in anyway. 

Holy mother of God, what a mistake we made. 

We walked into cluck-u and nobody was at the counter to take our order (warning sign number 2). We looked at the menu for at least a good five minutes before (presumably) the only employee working comes out from behind the counter to take our order. We all order and then go grab a table. While we're waiting on our food one of my friends went to the restroom to wash his hands. He comes out of the restroom pale, and when we ask him what's wrong, he says the restroom smells like death and he almost vomited (warning sign number 3... when they don't even bother to clean the areas that you see, imagine what the kitchen looks like). I also go to the rest room to wash my hands and I can certainly confirm, there must've been a dead body stashed somewhere in there. There were also a good amount of empty beer cans in the trash can. 

Anyway, getting to the actual food, I'm not sure I've ever had worse hot-wings in my life. They had a mushy-breading on them, and it wasn't mushy because the sauce made it that way, no, it was mushy because the oil they were fried in wasn't hot enough. I ordered the sauce on my wings the second-hottest that they had. However when I tasted my wings, the sauce wasn't hot at all. It had more of a sweet flavor to it, which was an incredible disappointment, because, well, I like my wings hot. If I wanted sweet sauce, I would've got to a Chinese place and ordered sweet and sour chicken. 

All in all, this was undoubtedly the worst restaurant I've ever been to, hands down. I will never be returning. Ever. I think I'd rather like my dog's own scrotum then eat here again.",2011-09-26 05:42:24

The first time I made my own burrito. I got the original size and was surprised by how big it was. CP got the small. I like the make your own option and it's convenient because they have a list of all the ingredients they offer to help you out. It was tasty, the ingredients were well mixed. I had pork and it was very tender. Plus some beans, caramelized onions and salsa. yum.

Next time I ordered the summer burrito with chicken. I added caramelized onions again because they are awesome. And we still loved it. It's also fun to use their future like soda machine and make a bunch of different flavors.

So yes.  It probably only deserves four but it gets the fifth because I love it that much.

Onto the food: The new spicy chicken sandwich is a thing of beauty, and way better than the competitor spicy chickens around.  It's just the right blend of hot without being overwhelming and it benefits from being eaten plain, or just with mayo.  For some reason the cheese, lettuce and tomato only serve to mess with the flavor.

However, it's not really the lunch here that won over my heart, it was the breakfast.  Chick-fil-A has hands down the best breakfast food of any fast food chain.  The chicken biscuit is flaky and salty and sweet (if you add honey like I do) all at the same time and it's perfect.  The chicken minis come on teeny tiny rolls that are fluffy cushions of buttery goodness.  The tater tots are about the size of a three nickels stacked on top of each other and the perfect accompaniment  to the rest of your meal.

I asked the employee if I could add cheese to the special and she happily said ""yes, but it's a dollar more to add cheese to both of them."" Really? A dollar more? sigh. ok. Well, when I get to the window, they first ask me to pull up to wait for my order. After it came, I pulled away and opened one of my biscuits to see that there was no cheese. So, I drove back, parked and went in. When I got in there, no one acknowledged me. The cashier and order filler were chatting at one end of the counter. I finally got their attention and some help. After I explained to the manager, she said ""no problem"" and took the bag to the ""sandwich maker."" He grabbed two slices of cheese and while he put one in the first sandwich, the second piece of cheese was being dragged all over the counter. He then put that now contaminated cheese, back where it came from while he opened the second sandwich. Finally he grabbed the contaminated cheese slice and threw it in the trash.

In this case I think the customer service reflects on management attitude and store policy, so it's worth mentioning. 

tl;dr - I showed up ten minutes before the closed. They shut off the lights while I was in the drive through, and then refused to acknowledge me at the window. 

I arrived at about 11:50PM and attempted to order at the drivethrough.  After waiting for two minutes, I said ""Hello"" to see if anyone was listening.  About thirty seconds later, all of the lights in the parking lot and drive through shut down.   So I pulled up to the drivethrough window to check the posted hours and see if there was anyone there who could serve me.  By this time it was 11:55.   The posted hours said the drive through is open until midnight.  Inside there were three girls working on cleaning up.  All three of them saw me (and I was visible on the TV monitor mounted inside) so they knew I was there.  One of them even made eye contact.  But they evidently wanted to leave immediately after closing, so they had decided to close down early.  Rather than acknowledging me and telling me they were closed, they just continued cleaning up, and occasionally glancing in my direction to see if I'd left.  I waited three more minutes (just in case they were planning to come by once they finished cleaning) and eventually left. 

I've worked in a shop and I understand the temptation to shut down early and start cleaning so you can get out early.  But employees need to understand that the posted hours are there to tell customers how late they're open - not to indicated when employees get to go home.  Management should be paying them for 30 minutes past closing, to allow time for cleanup, and should be enforcing the posted closing times.  The behavior I saw was utterly rude, and terrible for business.  If the management of this restaurant can't even get their employees to keep the store open, I can only imagine how unsuccessful they might be at maintaining health and hygiene standards.

To clarify about the order kiosk, I think they have their place but to completely rely on them is just a cheap cop out so your inadeqaute employees don't have to interact with people.  The Wendy's order app is cumbersome and took us 3 times as long to place our order than if we could have just talked to someone at the counter.  
Overall, just a reminder that robots can not replace a human when it comes to interacting and creating an experience.  If you're going to get the kiosk, okay.  Please make it so people don't have to have a frustrating experience when all they want is a quick and easy meal.",2018-06-09 17:02:09

It was paste. Completely texture-less, tasteless, grey, lukewarm glue. With half a banana, a sliced strawberry, and some very bitter/sour berry puree on top.

It's a nice little spot for a quick bite that has quite delicious offerings. From katsu bowls to California rolls to udon they have a decent variety. My girlfriend and I decided to try the hot udon with tempura and ontama ( slow cooked egg) and they were delicious but just a bit too salty. We also had their chicken karaage, which is what I think they are most known for because it's very good. The bowls were around $6 each plus 3 pieces of karaage was around $4 , so the price was very reasonable. 

They don't have free water or tea ( didn't notice it anywhere) but you can buy a cold green tea drink for .50 cents when you buy a meal which was very delicious and refreshing. Also you have to buy hot sauce for .25 cents which I found a little lame..

The description online for this juice says that they add Bremners cherry juice to it, which I am fine with because it is 100% cherry juice.

Both employees were quite cool and did not greet me when I walked in. It seemed as though they were upset that someone had come in to buy a sandwich.  

I ordered and waited near the front while a young man in a pony tail proceeded to make the sandwich. When he finished instead of handing it to me he set it at the opposite end of the counter.  I walked over to get it and this is where it gets funny. He has walked away but still looking at me I guess to see how I'll react when I see that it's sitting there without a bag or napkins.  After a few moments he says the bags and napkins are right there and points to them on his side of the counter.  Hmm, I'm not sure customers need to be reaching over into the prep area and I'm thinking this is interesting, I bought the sandwich and I think your job is to make the sandwich and place in a bag.

I'm a pretty solid Chipotle fan. Unfortunately,

1. Chipotle is more out of my way between my bus stop and home
2. Sometimes I crave gross processed melted cheese product with my Americanized Mexican chain food

So, I hit up Qdoba on my way home from my evening class.

Now, let me get this out of the way: I hold places like this to a much lower standard than an independent restaurant. Basically, chains are good for 3 things: consistency, satisfactory adherence to health codes, and that fake, corporate-mandated friendliness. 

Basically, if I walk into Qdoba, get greeted with a smile, have my entree prepared by a hygienically sound person wearing gloves, and that entree tastes the same as every other time I've walked into Qdoba, it's a 5 star Qdoba experience for me. 

This time, I walked in, wasn't acknowledged by the employee until I greeted him myself, and proceeded to order a veggie burrito bowl with guac. I walked out with a veggie burrito bowl without guac, and having been charged for a chicken bowl. Of course, I didn't notice any of this until after I got home. 

They earn 1 star because when I called, the manager said I can get a free entree next time (she sounded like she has never handled this type of complaint before and told me to write her name on the receipt and they would honor that...). 

The second star is for the fact that my queso tasted predictably plasticky. Just the way I expected. 

Doubt I'll return for that free entree...",2013-11-15 04:53:41

The funny thing about it though, me being Italian I've never in my life seen a calzone made without ricotta cheese! I actually have to go all the way to Revere to find a real calzone. But it's convenient when you have a little one and rely on public transportation. 

The worst part of the order is the big guy that delivers the food is so rude! No smile, no thank you, not even the decency of eye contact! Even if you tell him thank you or try to make small talk because he makes you feel so uncomfortable, he'll just ignore you and little short of shove your food in your face.

So this review was actually stopped short last week because I decided to order a buffalo chicken salad. Yum I thought! Look at all that chicken, beautifully seasoned somewhat fresh veggies until I hit that people cucumber! Well I thought if I just picked it out everything else looked ok. WRONG I got violently ill about 30min later! Shaking, cold chills, fever, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea even restless legs. My husband was about to call an ambulance at 3am because I was dehydrated an pretty much convulsing. 
Since the new owner the food has just gone down hill and it's still getting lower! Tonight all recovered I was craving french fries. Safe I thought an they were. But I was almost confused, I couldn't figure out if I ordered French fries from a pizza joint or a Chinese place! My fries showed up in a Chinese food container, they were soggy from heat condensation an bland very bland!

Another box had no cheese. When I brought in the boxes back into the store, Chaibia Sali (owner), told me they didn't cut the cheese to put in the biscuit. I told her the group I was with isn't from Ohio, so we wouldn't have known this. We exchanged words for about 2 minutes right next to the register customers were ordering food. Instead of moving us to the side so she could defuse the situation, she was quick with the attitude and high pitch.  

On top of the horrible customer service, the food wasn't even good. The tater tots were hard and seemed like they were old and just put back into grease to heat them up. The biscuits on the minis were bad and it seems like the cheese had been left out and was drying up. 

I've been to a lot of Chick-fil-As. Not one Chick-fil-A I've been to has had an issue putting cheese on/in the minis. I've been able to order whole platters of minis with cheese. I've also NEVER had a manager at a Chick-fil-A not ensure a positive customer service experience.",2017-05-15 14:32:04

I go for my monthly fix of diner food during the 3am time frame while studying for finals. At first there were two or three servers during the late night early morning shift, but now there is just one waitress. She is usually so attentive and quick, but with so many customers she is always frazzled and pulled in too many directions. She has too many tasks on her hands. She keeps people waiting for a seat and last night we waited exactly 7 minutes. There are homeless people sleeping in the front area and almost always in the seats to the right. It ruins the atmosphere when theyre snoring and the smell is rancid (being honest)

When my food came out I noticed. I was missing sausages in the Slam. I didnt even bother to ask because the server hadnt been by in ten minutes. Wait time was terrible. Management is really taking this place to the dumps. No servers, one absent minded cook, plus huge groups of hungry people? Why dont you hire even ONE MORE server so they can work the cash register as well as serve food before it gets cold? She kept mixing up my drink order and delivered a wrong order to someone who ate half of it until the server realized it was a mistake. A couple groups just left after being in the line to BE SEATED. 

The cook and server also got into a little bit of a fight.. Pretty loud, and not good for a business when everyone stops eating to listen to them. The tables are wiped down with a dirty rag and it leaves a sticky smelly residue on the table. Had to wipe my seat down with a napkin because of the crumbs and bits left on it. I ordered scrambled eggs and it smelled terrible, like raw chicken on the verge of going bad.. A dank, dark smell. I noticed halfway through unfortunately. If i hadnt been waiting so long and so hungry, i probably would've found the smell sooner.

I said, ""Yes.  I will take two slices.  Let's do it.""

20 minutes later my friends had finished their slices while I am still waiting.  I went back to the counter to ask how long it would be until, I got my pizza.  The woman said she had not put the order in, yet.  WTF??

What were you waiting for? Well, the other girl (she was standing next to) did not tell her to put the pizza in.  WTF??? 

Ultimately, she, as I was told, was the manager said she could put the pizza in now.  She offered me 3 slices instead of the two I ordered.  I said she should also, refund our entire meal.  To that she said she could, ""Meet [me] half-way.""

My friends were done eating more than 10 minutes before.

I think this whole problem and the resolution were unacceptable.   Her offer to ""meet [me] half-way"" was bulls hit as I did nothing wrong only she/Hot Lips messed up but, she was only willing to go half the way to a resolution she caused 100% of the problem. 

The place was dirty.  Women's bathroom was also, a major fail.  One of two sinks did not work at all.  The handles spun but, nothing came out.  The paper hand towel dispenser did not work.  Apparently, they knew this and left a new roll of paper hand towels on the counter, in a puddle for users to use both hands to tear paper off. I do not know how well or IF the prior person putting their hands all over this same roll washed their hands nor how well or poorly.  Lastly, the small trash bins were placed on the counters and we're overflowing.

Seeing this I should have been prepared for the terrible service.

I got the vegetarian mango salad taco bowl for $7.29 ($7.80 after tax) with both mild salsas and ended up with a filling salad I could by no means finish!

Nice, flavored tofu in a creamy peanut sauce with Asian slaw and crispy, cool cucumbers.  It's an explosion of flavors in your mouth.  Boloco is super vegan friendly (Yay) and there are a bunch of different options. I like that you can also choose different sizes of burritos, depending on how hungry you are.  Sometimes a baby burrito will do, sometimes you're staving and you want a regular.  Great deals with a pre-loaded Boloco card.  Staff is super friendly and fast.

Yesterday I was craving shrimp, so I went to closest place to where I lived that had some. Cost me over 13 bucks for a few shrimps with some nasty fries and a couple slices of diced cabbage in mayonnaise they called cole slaw.
The shrimp was probably frozen for decades, and tasted like rubber that was laying on the bottom of the ocean since the sinking of Titanic. In fact, maybe the shrimp was brought on the Titanic to be served on the ship and went down with the ship, only to be caught and served at New York Pizza a century later.
I had to throw it out, and had legitimately started to feel very nauseous and had a vile taste in my mouth. After drinking some pepto bismol and finding some other food, I finally returned to my normal self.

My sandwich was really good, and I have never had a bad sandwich here. The dining area and tables are always clean, as well as the counter area and the bathrooms.

Every time I have been here, I receive a hello and welcome to Firehouse Subs as I enter. And whenever my order is delivered to my table, the employee have always been courteous.
On a few previous visits, I did encounter a few problems. Nowhere in the building did I see anything posted as to whether Firehouse Subs takes credit/debit cards. Not on the front door as you enter, nor is there anywhere at the register with information posted. I had to ask if cards were accepted for payment.
Another problem I had on a recent visit was having to wait for over five minutes at the register  before placing my order because the cashier was having to answer several questions over the telephone with a caller asking about Firehouse Subs. Could this telephone call have been taken in the office? And why couldn't a employee start my order while this person was on the telephone? And what really made me mad was how the employee treated me after he got off the telephone. Just because someone was on the phone asking you several questions, don't make me feel stupid if I have a question regarding my order.
Parking is no problem, even though it is shared with a dry cleaning business. And there are tables for outside dining. Being located on Colonial Drive, traffic can make getting to this Firehouse Subs a problem, especially when the right lane merges into the next lane just before the entrance to parking, causing traffic to back up.
Most of the time, your order is made promptly and the food is brought out to you in a timely manner. But if you have a group of twenty people or more come in, be prepared to wait. This happened to me on one recent visit, and it took much longer for my order to be taken and brought out to my table.

First we came because my celiac daughter was anxious to try out the Gluten Free bun.  She was thrilled as it tasted good and she was glad to finally be able to eat like a ""normal"" person.

The second phase is when my wife wanted the watermelon mint lemonade (which she loves) but was told there was an up-charge for the lemonade.  My wife balked and asked for a small but frustrated because it cost more money.  So after we paid for dinner ($40 for 5 to eat...pricey for fast food but we know CFA isn't cheap) the worker told my wife that her lemonade doesn't get free refills.  She could get regular lemonade but not the special watermelon stuff.  Well...that would have been nice to know before she decided to spend the money and then she probably would have paid extra for the next size up if she knew she couldn't get a refill.

So...we had a good meal.  Food was good.  Fries were hot.  My daughter loved the GF bun for her sandwich.  BUT the cheap route out on the lemonade which I am sure what they charge for the lemonade in the first place could have covered multiple refills.  

Anyway...I am sure we will be back.  It would just be nice to have the order takers be more upfront about ""hidden costs"" vs finding it out after the damage has been done!",2017-08-09 03:26:11

This place is incredibly understaffed and their waitstaff is rude.  The latter is most likely because of the former, but multiple trips there have confirmed it - this place is awful.  Can usually get seated right away, but the staff usually have to wipe off a table for you beforehand.  After that, it's a toss up as to if you'll have your order taken in closer to ten minutes or twenty.  

The biggest problem for me - they ignore the huge lines they get there.  Yeah, I realize you're busy, but take a second to say ""be right with you!"" - don't just avoid eye contact and walk right past us.  I waited so long there the last time I went that I 1) contemplated ditching my bill and 2) almost just tossed some cash (with 0 tip) on the counter and left.  Luckily my waitress's tip was salvaged because someone stepped in right in time.  

That's another thing: making your customers walk up to the register to pay your ticket is a bitchy thing to do.  I should be able to write down my tip (usually a generous 20-25%) in confidence and privacy, not have it hounded from me.  Bastards.

Working in the financial district of Boston you are given tons of options for lunch, it should be cemented in the business model to provide a good experience for all patrons. I figured I would try something new today, going to the Boloco on School St where I have yet to go. I ordered online, therefore the excuse ""I misheard you"" does not fly. I ordered a bowl of chicken, lettuce, brown rice, sour cream, beans, corn salsa, hot salsa, and a hard boiled egg for good measure. What I got was chicken, beans, rice and corn. Not lettuce no salsa no egg. The bowl was half filled and looked pitiful. It was the biggest scam of a lunch I have seen. Needless to say I will not be returning.

For a big, reasonably healthy, meal, Chipotle's burrito choices have little competition.  They are a decent value, relatively healthy (brown rice is now offered); they are LADEN with a lot of carbs and proteins - if you don't watch it, these little donkeys COULD go straight to your ass!  

You can put in the ingredients of your choice, most of them at no charge.  Now, at over $6 a burrito, they are a pricier fast food option, and because of their size, I've found them a bit much as a lunch choice (unless you happen to be coming out of a hunger strike).

I am glad I did. I'm new to the idea of the build your own cafe style pizza, but I have eaten pizza in some of the more famous places across the country from Chicago style in Chicago to thin crust in New York, to the worlds worst Dominos attempt at pizza. 

This place is good. Just plain good. The thin crusts they use are very reminiscent of the thin crust styles used in Southern New Jersey, not quite New York, but slightly chewy, slightly salty and a bit charred. Delicious. The toppings were nearly all what I would have hoped. Freshly saut√©ed broccoli, cauliflower, good quality pepperoni, a nice selection of peppers and a great selection of cheeses. High quality garlic and artichokes, just very well rounded. Nothing looked unappetizing, and everything tasted fresh. They do use that somewhat fake precooked and formed tyson style chicken that subway uses, I am guessing for ease of use, which I find to have a horrid texture but I don't imagine most people would mind. It just seems out of place with all the other high quality ingredients. 

The service was great. All the employees were helpful and friendly, everything was done correctly and ready quickly. Seating was ample and casual.

The breading was always crispy, never soggy, and never too thick. It sort of flaked off in places, but the spice mixture they used was there in every bite. I'm not great at discerning the different herbs in a mixture, but there was definitely some cayenne mixed in to give it just a small bit of heat.  The chicken always ALWAYS tasted fresh and was usually quite juicy. Only once or twice did an order arrive that was a little dry on the inside.

I don't know. Maybe everyone ordered wings that sucked, or the sandwiches were poorly done. Personally, I'd take the leftovers and heat up 2 of them with a slice of pepperjack cheese and make a spicy bistro sauce and have that on a sandwich bun. Almost better than the chicken itself.

But at any rate, the place sits empty now, a For Lease sign in the window.

Hope you're happy, Old North. You gone and killed what was my favorite chicken place in the city (yes, better than Canes).  I just wish my opinion was shared by more, and that my own 3-4 orders per month could've sustained the place.",2012-02-06 22:46:30

It could get the worst reviews of any pizza place in Portland and it would still do good business strictly due to its location, which means reviewing it at all is somewhat of a pointless cause.

First off, the people working here were friendly and laid-back, yet weren't slackers by any means. They were fast to get my pizza to me and even offered me a discount. I have no problems with them whatsoever. The restaurant itself, however, left a lot to be desired. I went in wanting to get pizza by the slice, but quickly changed my mind when I saw the pizzas available. They looked old, dried-up, and hard as a rock - some even appeared to have flies festering around them. They could've been laying out for two hours, or they could've been laying out for eight hours for all I could tell. All I knew is that I didn't want any of those slices coming anywhere near my mouth. Apparently when you order a slice, they do re-heat it by sticking it in the oven real quick, but I've never been a fan of that method because it's something I could easily do at home using leftovers.

So I went with the other option, which was ordering a fresh pizza. Unfortunately, the pizza was pricey ($17.50 for a 13-inch) and wasn't anything special in the taste department. Everything had a sort of bland taste to it and I felt no desire to eat more than two slices. I didn't hate it, yet at the same time I regretted buying it and know I'll never come here again.

The building itself was kinda dirty and had a weird smell next to the bathrooms. What was rather off-putting was that the window in the men's room was open and I could hear people eating outside only a few inches away from me as I used the urinal. Whether or not they could see me remains a mystery, but I don't fancy the idea of others watching me urinate, and I'm sure people eating their pizza don't fancy the idea of watching me urinate either.",2013-07-18 04:25:08

I eagerly waited for this place to open, watching from my office the preparation for the preceding months as the food selection in this area gets boring week after week. When I discovered they had finally opened I dropped in to see what they had the first chance I could get. 

Their menu selections are simple enough, lots of choice for everyone both veg, vegan and carnivore - just at prices that almost make you feel like you are being shaken down. Though healthy, owners do need to realize they aren't the only game in town when it comes to healthy choices and though the micro greens are good, its not enough to compel me to pay an exorbitant premium.

Ordered a salad that could easily have been put together at any number of salad bar places in the area  - for much less. Smak has a clever idea, nice enough ""hip"" layout but sadly their pricing model is a little absurd.

My advice, for salads that is - improve the portions/more feta and other substantial components to the salad -or- drop your price by $3.

The prices are right and there are many options available to you based on your appetite and what you are looking for .... Kid Meals, Bowls, two & three entree boxes. It's all good!

No welcome to DD's or Good Morning how may I help you. Just plain ""what do you want?"" . I order a small coffee (hot) and a small iced with 5 sugars. The young lady who also was on the clock made the order however the sugar in my iced was not melted, so asked if it can be melted and told JAMES Who then proceeded to fix it I simply asked him if he could not add too much of the hot coffee in the cup to melt the sugar because I looked at the cup and the amount of coffee in it was half of full, (which would defeat the purpose of my getting the actual iced coffee.)He had an issue with what I asked and tells me it's not regular sugar being used to make my coffee, but that it was donut sugar  I'm like what? And he says it's not regular sugar so it's not going to melt.. and I explained that I worked for a Dunkin before and that doesn't makes since, there is either regular grain sugar or powered sugar so I'm confused. I know for a fact that sugar can be melted however I ended up asking for no sugar because of me having to get to work but I asked for caramel to be added to the coffee. Long story short the coffee was disgusting and I asked for a refund and was told I couldn't get my refund because there was no manager present, which was weird for the morning shift. I left a note with my name on it for the manager so I can get my refund after work and manager still was not present so I was told to come in tomorrow morning and the manager should be there, hopefully she is because this is very inconvenient to me. Her name is Krystal I was told so we'll see what happens but the service here in the morning is terrible and unprofessional.

The two employees in the afternoon shift and the young lady from the morning shift were helpful as much as they can. But that dam cashier James is very unprofessional and seems to not want to work.",2018-09-05 21:48:10

I really admire a company that puts their principles into action over profits (remaining closed on Sundays) and I really don't care what others think of it.  With that being said Chick-Fil-A couldn't stay in business without having the best chicken in the business and there's no doubt here that when it comes to chicken you're not going to find any fast food chains with better chicken.  

Yes Popeyes! chicken is totally awesome but it's also a totally different style of chicken than Chick-Fil-A.  I think the only food that could challenge them is Raising Cane's chicken.  Not only is this restaurant clean and brightly lit, with very friendly people but you will also find the place really a great place to take children as they have a huge area for them to play in.  

I typically get a spicy chicken sandwich and a side of chicken noodle soup (which is delicious) but their wraps, especially the grilled chicken wrap is great if I'm in the mood to eat a little healthier.  At many fast food restaurants the ""healthy"" food is something you suffer through when you're watching your waistline but not the wraps here, I'd order them just because they are that good.  

Their fries are really good *IF* they are just fresh made but I find once they get to room temperature they really are pretty average.  So make sure that if you get fries you get them hot and eat them while they're hot!

I was okay not getting any meat but as I was eating my bowl I had a huge chunk of uncooked rice in my bowl and it was terrible. I wish this wasn't the closest chipotle to my new apartment. I'm very unsatisfied with my purchase from here.,2016-06-17 01:44:14

This is MY kind of spot!

Good eats, vegan options, gluten options, plenty of pie varities, local brews

The pies are well spiced with lots of ingredients. This visit I tried the vegan focaccia, basil breadsticks. My friends had pepperoni, veggie and bacon slices. Each slice is good size portion. I really liked they were not stingy with my veggies and spices! I never knew how much I would enjoy black beans, corns, whole size garlic cloves and other veggie treats on my pie!  For those picky eaters wanting only one or two toppings, you may want to look elsewhere.

This place also advertises local products used which also is another plus.

I really like the atmosphere too. Laid back feel, with seating both inside and outside and even some couches to chill on. It reminds me of a college feel, and guess what... its located by Portland University.",2012-06-05 21:48:21

Why am I suddenly writing about this place? Because today I got some take-out from a Japanese place near Finch Station that served reasonably priced, fast-food style dishes that reminded me of my trips to Ebi-Ten each time I was in Vancouver. But it's without a doubt that the meals offered at Ebi-Ten look appetizing and also comfort your soul once the first spoonful hits your mouth.

Located across from the Coliseum-like central branch of the Vancouver Public library, this little place with it's Japanese staff and style of service is sure to win your heart and appetite. After my first meal experience here, subsequent trips to Vancouver were never completely without returning here at least once for a comforting meal. Every dish on the menu board looks tempting but I've always picked one of the katsu curry dishes and made it a combo with a drink.

Anyone who is craving for a homely, quick-fix Japanese meal in a more low-key atmosphere should definitely check this place out. You'll be dreaming about their dishes that night. I'm so glad that it's still around at it's current location.",2016-03-10 20:25:21

Went back recently for lunch to see if it had improved. My wife has complained that we never stop there when we go out, so we did. I checked out the restroom and it is marginally better, but still pretty bad.

The service was half-good. We got one order correct out of two. My wife's beef sandwich order arrived as a plate of sliced pork, which was convenient, since that's what I had. It made it easy to point out how slicing the pork with the grain makes for tough strands of meat instead of tender pieces.  Might fool people into thinking they get a lot for their money, since it takes longer to chew.

I have to even agree with Michael on this one- this is THE place to gain the freshman 15! (I can pretend Apollo's is just a bit too healthy to qualify for this distinction, right?)

Charles's evolution at Cluck-U mirrors my own: I started getting Cluck-U delivered for the Cluckwiches, and quickly learned to switch to Sloppies. Sloppies are a lot like PJ's Super Sandwiches or whatever they're called, but just slightly more modest. Add in the fact that Cluck-U chicken is a lot more tender and juicy than it has a right to be for fried crap, and you have my favorite delivery subs on campus.

Cluck-U also has ""world famous"" clucker bees. I don't know if kids in China have actually heard of these things, but whatever- I LOVE THESE THINGS. They're nothing more than wads of fried dough soaking in liquidy honey, but I can eat these practically by the dozen.

When I'm not quite in the mood for a Sloppy, Cluck-U's fried chicken is a good stand-by. It's not amazing fried chicken, but it's delivered to your door, and it's honey-dipped. Sweet, crispy and usually delicious.

Hot Lips was a huge treat for me and my brothers when we were little.

And I think it had sundried tomatoes?) that I wish I could have again.  Or remember accurately what was on it to recreate at home.

However, the guy could have left it in the oven just a couple minutes longer so that it would have been a little hotter.

The salad was very lame. They left the entire leaf in there so that it was very difficult to eat (i.e., the lettuce was not cut into small enough pieces). And because it's in a plastic container, it is very difficult to put the dressing on. It did seem like the dressings were homemade. They were okay, but the ranch was too runny and the balsamic vinaigrette was far too thick. It's like they switched rolls with each other.

The service is okay. There is normally a line when I go but you can't really help it, it depends on the customers ordering in front of you as well.

Pros: Large slices, mind-blowing house-made sodas, decent pricing, lots of seating, cool vibe, personable staff

Cons: Can be dirty, inconsistent in wait times, awkward lines 


Now that you've skimmed that, I'll expound.

The slices are seriously huge - you can see it in the pictures. They're about $3.50-4.50 per, which isn't totally unreasonable considering that one is pretty filling. A whole pizza, or ""pie,"" is around 20ish. That's... decent, but not exactly a deal. Flavors depend on the day, and there's always a special. Is the pizza fantastic? No, but it's good or great, depending on the flavor. Grab plenty of napkins because it can get pretty oily up in there.

As for the sodas? Don't even get me started! Woo! Okay, well the cherry one is a bit weird, but that's just preference. I promise it doesn't take Tylenol. Try the boysenberry. That's my number one. Or marionberry, which is a tad sweeter.

The inside is very... ""scattered,"" I would say. Lots of colors, textures, etc. Nothing really matches, but that's a part of the appeal. The bar area near the windows is made of reclaimed wood!

Here's an interesting story:

I went in on a Saturday (a tad slower that day) to grab a whole pizza for my friends, since we were in the PSU library studying all day. I got a 20 inch pizza, half pep and half veggie, and it costed around $28. They said it'd be ready in about 15 minutes. Okay, cool. No big deal.

20 minutes later, I peak in and ask how long until the pizza is ready. A woman working there said ""sorry, I dropped your pie. It'll be another 15."" Well.... Okay. Things happen, but maybe you could have mentioned it earlier...? 

I found it strange and awkward that she didn't apologize or offer anything, as most other places would. I'm honestly not one to feel entitled and ask for free stuff, but I was already running late, offended by the lack of sincerity, and I felt the need for justice. I went up to the counter (after I had gathered the courage) and asked the lady if I could grab some drinks since the pizza was so late. To my surprise, she was extremely kind and said ""go for it!"" Stunned, I uncomfortably grabbed 2 sodas, since I didn't want to take too many things.

After the extra 15 minute wait, I went up to grab my pizza and a gentleman at the bar said ""didn't you have to wait for a new pizza?"" And I said yes. He said ""why don't you grab some stuff? It's on us!"" I told him I had already grabbed 2 sodas and he said ""oh, that's not nearly enough."" He handed me a drink carrier and said ""take some more sodas, and here's 2 cookies. Do you want some chips, too?"" And it was all VERY genuine, not forced or rude. Again, I was stunned, and took the opportunity to grab some more sodas. I didn't take him up on the chips or cookies because it was far too kind!

Ultimately, the staff should've handled the situation better from the start - tell your customers when things are delayed, apologize, and try offering something as repayment. But, my goodness, they were so kind and personable afterward!

I still go back in. Customer service means a lot to me, and I appreciated the way they handled the situation. The staff there is still really cool and genuine. You just have to initiate.",2014-02-11 22:10:37

Last time I was there, I ordered a special that consisted of ginger pork, tempura, a little salad (mostly shredded cabbage), miso soup, and rice. Damage was about $11. Ginger pork was good, though sliced just a little too thick. The tempura was made fresh to order and was pretty good. The miso soup, cabbage, and rice were standard.

Don't expect anything exquisite or fancy. This is, after all, convenience food. So in the realm of convenience food, this place would get 4-4.5 stars. Compared to everything else available, they get a solid 3 stars. A-OK!",2013-11-25 11:25:02

The staff made no effort to offer alternative suggestions that might work better when we informed them the kids couldn't eat the salty, spicy food. Nor did they make any apologies or offers of refunds. We didn't ask.

BLOWN AWAY, I tell you. Ok, the service was very average and no one had any personality - whatever. Honestly, they could've personally insulted me or even made a ""yo mama"" joke and I would still give them 5 stars. They're that good.

Plenty of seating inside and cute picnic tables outside which make for a good energetic people-watching spot, if a little noisy from the traffic. Lots of helpful, competent staff which means they get your order right and get it out to you pronto, no attitude or apathy.

I order the downtown dahl curry bowl and love it every time. It's vegan, spicy, and low fat. The menu also warns that this dish is not good for celiacs and that it contains nuts. With their clear markings and multiple dietary considerations, it's easy to find your own special option. The Downtown Dahl Curry bowl is best when they serve it up with even amounts of dahl and rice and top it over the brim with greens.

The Sweet Fire chicken was hot in temp, the broccoli & beef was on the down right cold side and the rest was warm on it's way to being cold and we don't live very far from this location and since the Sweet Fire was still hot, it tells me that the rest of it was old and not being kept at proper temperatures which is crazy because they added time to our wait time due to order size which makes you assume they are making everything fresh which is not the case..

But don't let the phrase, ""Japanese fast-food"" fool you. They serve it hot and fresh, and it tastes even better than most sit-in Japanese restaurants.

A couple days back, I dropped by this place upon recommendation from a friend. He had said, ""yo, check out this place. The food is fast, good, and it isn't too expensive."" Well hey, that's incentive enough for me to pay a visit!

Ambiance: Man, is this place busy or what? Dinner hours had just begun, and they are already lined up out the door. Needless to say, there were no seats available inside. Treat this place as a take-out joint, because honestly, the ambiance almost discourages you to stay too long. However, I think it serves its purpose.

Service: The people taking the orders were smiling and friendly. That's all I would ever expect from this place. I'm very satisfied!

Value: These are the cheapest Japanese food that I have found, up to date. If you are looking for a deal, then this is where it's at. For a nice meal plus a pop or a large bowl of miso soup, you are charged ~8 dollars. That works for me!

Food: The dish my friends and I had were quite good. The chicken teriyaki combo and the beef teriyaki combo were both very tasty. It's almost surprising that the meals here taste better than a lot of the Japanese restaurants around. Did I mention that these guys are fast? 3-4 minutes per order, roughly. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals.

Verdict: Filling up that big empty void in my stomach would require more than just a few slices of sushi, and that would probably empty out my paycheck fairly quickly if I was to eat elsewhere. So I propose two possible solutions:

1. I can try and make more money... somehow...
2. I can go to Ebi-Ten

I think the choice is obvious. 
I need to make more money.

But seriously, Ebi-Ten is definitely worth your visit. If you want to eat Japanese food regularly? Right here. If you aren't a huge fan of Japanese food? Still, this would be a good recommendation regardless. 

Ebi-Ten will definitely get my business again in the future.",2009-11-22 11:13:18

My son had the works on his meatball sandwich.  Both toasted please............In the microwave and out faster than we could realized our food was nuked!!  Eh gahd!  What happened there?  I don't like microwaved bread.  The bun gets all hard and indigestible.  But the damage was done and after she explained that the toaster oven was broken.   So I couldn't really complain.  I should have asked for another on and had it cold instead, but too late and I didn't have the heart to ask.  So I picked at the bread and tossed out the hard chunks of bread while I ate the sandwich in the car.

My only suggestion, is to please ask the customer first if they would like to have the sandwich microwaved.  I fought so hard to get McD's to stop doing this.

If it weren't for the sauerkraut  and hippie vegetarian options, no one would raise an eyebrow to see Mustard's on Ashland and Milwaukee.

Prices are steeper than what I pay in Chicago, but I suppose this is the cost of exile. On the other hand, the ingredients tasted fresh and zippy. Would definitely eat here regularly if I lived in Boulder.

Smak is one of those microgreens bars which has the machines that actually create the proper microclimate to grow the greens inside the restaurant. As such, it can prepare an inordinately fresh salad. I was surprised because the machines they use were exactly what I saw on Dragon's Den a few years ago.

Now, if only super-fresh microgreens were actually much better than what you can get at a normal salad bar that probably buys its greens at the start of the day from a grocer. A difference? Very minute if any.

But is such a difference so noticeable as to make it worth it to buy a $10 salad that left me hungry with a very unsatisfactory grapefruit-flavored dressing? The ""nori wraps"" that one of my coworkers had looked like tiny maki rolls, 3 of them, and those were $15. Seriously - this kind of lunch is just not affordable and not worth it, not with the prevalence of cheaper salad bars AND food carts that can offer a better variety on fare.

It has a hip metropolitan layout inside but instead of making it very accessible, it felt like a mass production line because the fridges storing their salads was right next to the door. Then you go into cordons until you can pay, and make your way to a table. They don't have any water available which, if you're going to spend $10 for health food, you probably would favor drinking anyway. 

So, all in all, NO. Not worth it particularly given the SaladLoop just down the street. The greens are fresh but don't taste noticeably different from anything else.",2013-06-04 05:49:06

Thus, when I refer to Hot Lips Pizza, you can pretty much take that to mean Hungry Howies, Round Table, Pizzacatos, and all of the other **sigh** pizza parlors that you have all been poisoning yourselves with for untold years.

It's not your fault...you never knew better.  After all, when you were given these slices of Bisquick, stewed tomatoes and congealed cheese, how could you have known that there were other options, other pizzas in the world that take more than three minutes under a heat lamp to be made presentable for human consumption?

There are rules for pizza, after all:

1) Pizza sauce should NEVER be pre-made (as is the case here and at other ""fine"" PDX pizzerias) 
2) More like ""1b,"" but pizza sauce should take up to two days to properly cook, leaving time for all of the flavors to mature and breathe.
3) Good pizza NEVER comes in slices.  Ever.  God.
4) Good pizza should NEVER be subjected to the indignity of heat lamps or other warming devices - it is made to be consumed immediately, hot and fresh from the oven.  You will know the difference between the two, because a GOOD pizza will never last long enough to be considered ""left over.""
5) Good pizza does not in any way contribute to healthy living - vegetarian pizzas are a crime against whatever deity you hold sacred.

**sigh**

I love Portland...SO many good places to eat, so many awesome people, so much scenic beauty and natural wonder...

...but wow, the pizza...the horror...",2009-01-07 09:45:25

Every time I've gone through the drive-thru at this McDonalds, there has been a problem.  I don't know if the order-taker is keying in my order incorrectly, or if the cooks have problems comprehending, but I do not like cheese on my Filet O Fish, and I always order extra tartar sauce.

2 weeks ago, I made my usual order. Confident in their ability to get things right, I was livid when I opened my sandwich and found a dry filet, covered in disgusting orange cheese with NO tartar sauce. Too tired after a long work day to go back, I scraped the cheese off and added a couple of packets of Captain D's tartar sauce(not the same).

Last night, I made sure to check my bag before leaving the premises. Glad I did. I had ordered a McDouble to snack on later on. Guess what wasn't in the bag? Yep. And my Filet-O-Fish had cheese on it, once again!  How hard is it to just leave off the frigging cheese. I had to end up waiting an additional 5 minutes for the cook to remake my sandwich. Meanwhile, the fries got cold, and the manager didn't offer to refresh them or offer an apple pie or cookies for my inconvenience like other McDonalds have in the past.

$3.99 for the breakfast special.  It is described as follows:  ""2 eggs, homefries, toast, and choice of bacon, sausage, or ham steak.""

this is what you get:  a plain one egg omelette saturated in grissle, topped with three strips of overcooked bacon, parbaked potatoes that are just that... parbaked... like they forgot to actually cook them after parbaking them cold and coated in paprika, and wheat toast with no butter.

so... for $3.99.... i guess that's what you get.  Funny, I can get two eggs, toast, homefries, and bacon at another restaurant for the same price.  And I get a server.  And it is actually good.

This place is horrible!!

NOT what you want to hear from someone about to serve you food.  The girl scooping my ice cream flung a scoop onto the counter, picked it up with her hands, and then put it on my cone!!  GROSS!  My husband and I both ordered chocolate chip.  The girl scooped his first from one container of ice cream, then went into the back to get a new container to scoop mine from.  Mine was terrible.  Had no vanilla flavor and tasted like it had freezer-burn.  My husband's tasted much better, but he found an M&M in his and he is allergic to peanuts so he couldn't eat his anymore.  We went back to complain about them (something we NEVER do), and although they gave my husband money back for his they said that because each batch is homemade we can't expect different batches to taste the same so they couldn't give me my money back.

Just eggs, hamburger helper meat, and cheese.  Someone in my party ordered the 'truck stop' burrito for breakfast, and that looked pretty legit.  Also, someone in my party ordered the chorizo burrito and had a pretty upset stomach the rest of the day, but perhaps it was coincidental.

Aside from that, the atmosphere is pretty much like a Chipotle.  The staff behind the counter was very friendly.

And it is the only one with dinner hours within walking distance, so I stopped by for a burrito on my way to the movies.

I like how there are slightly healhier options such as brown rice and wheat burrito - or for a lower carb option you can go without the wrapper and have your burrito in a bowl.

Service was friendly, and the fella putting my burrito together didn't even look at me funny when I requested my dinner cut in two and wrapped separately.

There's a small area available for dining in by the front door, and the place seemed clean.

I highly recommend signing up for the Boloco card.  You can add value to it, but as a loyalty card you get a free menu item every time you accrue 50 points (1 point per $), and a freebie on your birthday.  Sign up to get emails too and once in a while you'll get a surprise freebie email such as the new Memphis BBQ Burrito I enjoyed tonight.

*** 5/2012 ***

They've just begun accepting LevelUp.  Nice to have the option, but with LevelUp you have to spend $100 to get $10 future credit, while with the Boloco card you get a freebie of your choosing for every $50 spent.  I'm not sure whether the two are combine-able or not, but with a small burrito costing $5.84 ($6 after tax), that could be $6 of free food after spending $50 with the Boloco card.

*** 12/2012 ***

Oops, forgot to use LevelUp.  Reminder to self - USE LEVELUP when I don't have my Boloco card at least.

A small for $6 after tax is plenty for my appetite.

*** 2/24/2013 ***

So, I received an email from Boloco regarding new Boloco Card terms and policies effective 2/25/2013, which has created 4 tiers to their memberships, has added an expiration date of 76 days for freebies (in comparison to Starbuck's period of 38 days), and now requires the cards to be registered to take part in the deals.

My card is most definitely registered, but the other changes has indeed lowered the value that this customer loyalty program had previously provided me... bummer.

I don't know about you, but with the highest level of membership now requiring 12 visits in a month EACH month, I have absolutely no chance at that since doing so would require an average of 3 visits per week, and me, I like my variety at lunch time.  And the comparison to Starbucks - sure, some folks get coffee on a daily basis, but lunch?  In Boston?  We might not be a mecca of good eating like NYC, but still, there are several options just outside my door!  It takes a relatively non-adventurous soul to frequent the same lunch spot *that* often when options abound in close proximity!

Fantastic!

Everything was good quality, this wasn't like trying to chew through some Dominos kind of plastic cheese, these were fresh, they looked great, and the selection was great. You can put as much as you want on that sucker for no extra charge, maybe next time I'll go all out. They take you down the line, they seem to know exactly how much of each topping to put on so at the end it's not overloaded but as definitely not lacking. It's a thin crust so this balance is important because of physics or something. Once you're done they pop it in the wood fired oven (I think) and it's ready a few minutes later. So easy!

The guys working were super nice, they seemed to be enjoying themselves and that makes a big difference in one's experience. I told them I'd never been there and they were super helpful with instructions and suggestions.

Here are the positives: size options on their burritos! This is great since I won't even try the Chipotle burritos for fear that I would eat that entire log. They offer a whole wheat tortilla as well as regular flour. They have some toppings that I wish others had: fresh cilantro & pickled onions. And they have some chip varieties so you can get kettle chips instead of tortilla chips if you are wanting to cut a few calories. 

Negatives: You have to order everything at the register before they make it. So if you have never been here before don't go at a busy time or you will have to wing it or be in everyone's way. The ticket system doesn't seem to be the most effective. Without you interacting with the person assembling there is a lot of room for error. Even my burrito was made incorrectly and I was the only one in line. 

Price is pretty standard. I spent $8 on a mini burrito, chips & guacamole. 

As far as taste it was good, but not remarkable. The couple of ingredients they left out on mistake probably would have helped and they might not have been inclined to put a giant handful of pickled onions on it to bulk it up. Good thing I wasn't on a date ...",2012-12-17 21:44:02

First off, I would like to point out that I don't even really like burgers, but I was feeling exceptionally lazy after work and decided to stop in. I gotta say, the girl behind the counter was probably the friendliest fast food person I have ever met. It was almost weird. Have you ever had good service from McDonalds? Burger King? Hell from any fast food joint? I haven't! So not being treated like poor white trash was kind of a surprise I wasn't ready for.

She told me what was in the veggie patty 30% soy and the rest is veggies or some such bullshit, and it was her favourite and guaranteed me that it would be mine too. She gave me a frequent burger buyer card thingy, so after X amount of burgers I can get a freebie, no offense but I eat burgers like once every five months, and by then I'll probably have lost the card by then, but thanks for the thought! I got the skinny fries and drink to go with the burger, fuck might as well right? Go big or go home, or in this case get fat or go home. I asked for some extra salt with my fries, and she gave me a little toolbox thingy with tabasco sauce, salt, pepper, frank's red hot (yes!) and vinegar. So if you need some fixin's you'll have to ask cuz they keep 'em behind the counter. 

The burger was alright, it was pretty salty, but not as FAT as I would have thought considering the name. I mean it was big, don't get me wrong, but the patty itself wasn't FAT, I have a feeling the fat is reserved for the meat burgers, in which case, eeewwwww. The fries were ok, personally I like mine skinnier, its the only thing McDonalds has ever done right in my opinion. The pop refills are bottomless but I can barely get through half of a pop, cuz then I start burping like a trucker, and there were other people in the restaurant, so I didn't want to be THAT person. ""Hey guy reading the paper, did you know I can burp the alphabet?"" Well, you do now, and no I'm not single. 

If I was a burger fan, I'd probably come back to this place, since everything was made fresh for me, and the service was so stellar, and I am grossly curious about the other veggie burger called the Cali Burger that has an egg on it.....  egg on a burger? Makes me think of steak and eggs for breakfast.... eeewwww... but I kinda wanna try it. The only problem with Fatburger was that the cost of this burger and fry combo was like $13, and honestly I could go to a nice sit down restaurant for that price, rather than a fast food joint on Davie. (Just Sayin') Maybe we'll meet again Fatburger in six months when my ass is less FAT and more PHAT. Oh who am I kidding, that'll never happen.",2012-09-28 01:44:29

I pretty much live on them at home, so I know a thing or three when it comes to their ingredients and preparation (which, by the way, are both minimal).

Sticky rice, lettuce, japanese mayo, sesame oil, gluten-free soy sauce, and maybe a little shredded nori for good measure -- a classic robin-dish if there ever were one.

Starving for food after the party at Vinalia (where the appetizers were vomitrocious) I remembered the late night glow from the windows of New York Pizza.

I ventured inside, where it appeared there were many others in my situation--craving late night grease.

I ordered myself a chicken cutlet sub and onion rings. The chicken cutlet sub was nothing to brag about, but definitely hit the spot. They were generous with the chicken, which seemed a better quality than other sub places I've tried. The onion rings were FANTASTIC. They were gigantic and oh so tasty. I'm not sure I ate them so much as INHALED them. I love New York!

Once again, when you are craving Taco Bell or KFC, it's good, it's not Mexican, it's not Southern.  It's KFC and Taco Bell.

But I'll digress.  This location is ridiculous.  Every single person working was too ghetto to function.  Also, open toed shoes? Hello OSHA.

The place was dirty, and three homeless teens ""showered"" in the restrooms while we were there.

I will say that one guy who appeared to be on break, did run into the kitchen and grab a rag to clean the tables so we had a place to sit, and then even swept the floor for us.

The food was okay, with this exception: they made my taco bell while Andy's chicken was still cooking (apparently they don't pre-cook the sauceless hot wings?)  so the crunch wrap had no crunch when it came out, but...it was fine.

If you've had a burger in a restaurant before, you know pretty much what to expect. Fatburger does what Vera's does, they do it well, and they cost slightly more while being slightly nicer to sit down in.

We ordered a turkey burger and a chicken burger with fries and soda pop. Again, pretty much what you'd expect, and perfectly competent.

One thing they do really well (as mentioned in another review) is customer service. The lady working the register was friendlier, more helpful, and more knowledgeable about the food than the staff at 90% of fine-dining places I've been to. What is she doing at a burger joint?

Leaving with my take-out, I accidentally spilled a drink. When I asked for some paper towels to clean it up, she whipped out a mop and got me a replacement drink inside of fifteen seconds. Really glad I tipped her well (remember, always tip on the value of the Groupon, not what you pay for it!). Multiple stars for customer service.

One star is taken off for the price (assuming you're not paying with a Groupon, in which case five stars all the way). For the price of a burger, fries and pop, you're pretty much at the price of an entree in a classier restaurant.

I did not come in here wanting a pizza pocket.  Such is my indignation, I am writing a review as soon as possible.  Yes, this review is coming to you LIVE, as I am eating at this establishment.

First of all, I can't hold this pizza in my hand without it drooping like a flaccid...  Well, I must just say, I am offended by this pizza drooping in my hand.
NOTHING REACTS THIS WAY TO ME.  
NOTHING... but ""pizza"" from ""Hot Lips"".

My ancestors risked death, prosecution, and the desecration of their ancestral vault by the bloody Communists in order to seek refuge in this country of ""freedom"" and ""democracy""... and I, as a descendant, feel most inclined to channel their valorous spirit.
...I demand higher quality pizza.

Furthermore, I feel it is imperative to mention that Mao was evil.  Communism is a political theory that is floppy, LIKE THIS PIZZA.  Shame on whoever who capitalises upon the advertisement of Mao's offensive visage on t-shirts and other propaganda.  I am looking at you, Urban Outfitters and Hot ""Shiesse"" Topic.  Tools of Capitalism AND Communism.  You SICKEN me.  I still browse UO, though.  Yea...

Also, why is there a creepy stalkerish man staring at me as I am typing this at Hot Lips?  He looks like the psycho-killer from Silence of the Lambs.  No, not Hopkins-Lecter; he was a Doctor of Class and Sophistication.  I am referring to the guy who was all like, ""I am going to wear your skin... I am going to make a lampshade out of your ass.""  
Culinarily-speaking, this play-doh pizza is the crud-slop of criminal proportions.

HAHA.  I see other people around me have floppy slices, too.  The look upon their faces!   ""Noooooooo...""

Why do I feel like I am on acid?  I did not drop ANY acid this morning.  And I certainly never have flashbacks whatsoever.  Such psychosomatic effects do not register.  I am an android.
Is there acid in this pizza?  
Might I suggest a switch to Viagra?  I want a firmer crust; I demand structural integrity!  

The drawings on the wall of the entrance:  They're trying too hard to be artsy and whatever, yet it appears as if only throwing some ""pizza"" at it would achieve a dimension of aesthetic.  Go back to art school, pretentious malodorous hipster.

And stop playing entire albums by Death Cab for Cutie and Eric Clapton!  I have had just about enough of Gibbard.  As for Clapton - does the staff want the customers to start slitting their wrists to supplement the sauce?  Perhaps that would add more KICK to it.

TO REVIEW, HOT LIPS PIZZA MUST WORK ON:
*Developing a pizza base which meets or exceeds my expectations.
*Stop attracting shady characters into your joint.
*Put on NOFX or the Descendants or something, OK?

...

Unfortunately, I have reason to suspect that my present state of disorientation is due to something I have eaten.  There is a harbinger at the back of my throat.  It seems I must now deal with the consequences of consuming a gateway food to Bulimia.

Let this be a lesson to you.

Hold on.  

Friends, Romans, Countrymen:  If you not hear from me again, it is because the agents of a Communist regime are waterboarding me for my insolence.  My only sustenance:  Hot Lips Pizza.  (They deliver.)  In the Communist Underworld, you don't eat Hot Lips Pizza.  Hot Lips Pizza eats YOU.
Therefore, I should stop bitching before echelon tracks down my ISP.  
But I won't.  
Especially since I fear NOTHING.  I know Kung Fu.  That's right.  Flight-or-fight.  There is never an option to poo, which is why I am so full of shit.  Just HOW do you think I got this far without a boomerang, you undiapered genius?  Do you feed your father those trousers?  
Good work.

Thank you for taking precious time out of your extremely busy schedule to read my highly serious review.  

Carry on!

Ever your fine-feathered friend,

You're a student at PSU or are just hanging around campus for kicks?
But you don't know if you should come here or go to Pizzicato down the street?

Let me help.

The short version of my advice is to come here for lunch, but go to Pizzicato any time after.

The pros of Hotlips are significant. Giant slices of pizza. Some of them are vegan if that's your jam. Homemade soda and several beers on tap. Plenty of seating + wifi. Funny, helpful staff. And their lunch specials are actually pretty great. They also have a reward system through a card/app called Belly. If you come back a few times, you'll be in line for some free stuff.

But they don't get a ton of traffic in the evening, which means that pizzas sit out for awhile. I've always found lunch slices to be fresher than dinner slices. When you consider that lunch specials do not apply to dinner time, you may be paying more later in the day for lower quality pizza.

During a visit to Chipotle on Kirkman Rd (near Metro West), I experienced both of the latter.  Upon entering, I was like ""cool"" they're wear gloves (which is not very consistent in the state of Florida) but as I placed my order things went downhill.  I requested no bell peppers but some fell into my food because it  found its way into the black beans so how... So I asked lady to get it out (thinking she would use a spoon) she proceeded to pick out the peppers with her hand - I was like ""for real"".  The person next to her decided to chime in (who wasn't fixing my food) and say - ""what! She is wearing gloves"".  As I took a deep breath in & rolled my eyes I said ""I don't want it"".  They proceeded to re-make it correctly with every bit of stank attitude they could muster without opening their mouth.  As I went down the line with a lose of appetite because I hate poor customer service and when the person working catches an attitude with the guest like they are doing them a favor and they are the ones paying for the meal or service. (but I digress....) 

Once my bowl hit the cheese station of the food conveyor belt - more hands were added to my meal with the cheese man using his hand to put the cheese on my food and I was like ""for real"" but this time the guy said ""what's the problem"" ... So I replied, you have on gloves but you are touching everything in sight.  This guy was getting containers from the back, open cabinets and handling various items like he was a circus-joggling act - all before he palmed a huge amount of cheese on my rice bowl and he NEVER changed his gloves.  I was over the entire experience, so I went to talk to the manager.  The manager response was even more trippy than her workers -  she said she saw it but ""didn't want to say anything to embrace her employees"" - huh WTH *perplexed look*  .... The difficulty of this simple lunch date went from bad to worse.  As we sat down and my companion ate his food, the manger came over with free meal cards for me - I politely declined and said ""I will never eat here again but you can give them to him.""

I tend to favor pizzas with meat, but on a lark, I chose a vegetarian special.  I can't recall exactly what was on it, but the toppings included roasted eggplant.  Redolent of nutmeg--with an excellent crust--this item was pure perfection.

The crust won't have that certain artisan flavor you'd find at Ken's, Apizza Scholls, or Wy'east (note: all ""wood fired"").  However, it would only be fair to say that not only has Hot Lips continued to transcend mediocre pizza-by-the-slice places (that's right, I'm looking at you, Pizza Schmizza), but stands on its own as a reasonably priced gustatory treasure.

I visited this business twice last week just to determine if this place was actually as bad as my first visit. First visit, I went in on the weekday I was the second customer in line and waited close to 12 minutes. The whole time I was there the manager Miranda was gossiping with her friends on the other side of the counter not having any care in the world about the customer service. She was interrupted by a employee and gave her a frustrated look and rolled her eyes at the staff member as she turned to gossip with her friend. I felt horrible for the way the staff member was treated by her manager. Miranda is not a proper trained manager, she has no people skills from what I witnessed nor did I see any coaching or encouragement coming from her. If anything she was harassing the  staff members and creating a hostile work environment. I ordered a Thai lemon grass burrito which took forever.  I asked the cashier for a refund and she stated that she  would need the manager to do authorize the refund. I saw the fear in her eyes and felt really bad for her and didn't want her to deal with Miranda any more.  I received my burrito which was just ok. Nothing that great about it, unsure if it was even put together the proper way since the manager was not overseeing the business. I went home and couldn't stop thinking about the way the staff member was treated. So I went back on the weekend with my friends and boy was it a different place. I was amazed!!!!!!!!! The service was fast and the food actually tasted great! We received an apologize for waiting for our food the wait time was 3 minutes which is not bad at all, the staff were happy and you can tell it was a different atmosphere.

PROS:   Great menu options!   Standard burritos and bowls, but they also have a variety of Tacos that are great!   I happen to also love that they carry Chalulua hot sauce!   That's key for me.  Ingredients are fresh and the Guac is super good.  

Qdoba beats out Moe's for ingredients by a landslide.  It has the edge on Chipotle with ingredients, but here's where they blow away Chipotle:

1.  Bottled soda!  Mexican coke!   Way better than fountain drinks.
2.  Chalula hot sauce.  Chipotle offers Tabasco.   Come on.  Tabasco is terrible for burritos
3.   Qdoba is clean and bright.  Chipotle restaurants all feel dark and dank.  

Bonus:  I got chips at Chipotle, I swear they were made of salt.  It was the grossest thing ever!   Too much salt, I could not eat them.  Qboda has better chips.  I didn't add this above, because I'm not sure if I got a bad batch at Chipotle, or maybe it was the location. 

CONS:   None that I can think of.

This is a great hole in the wall hot-dog stand. Their jumbo beef hot dogs are so incredible, and paired with the fact that they have gluten free buns, it is really a rare treat. They have a good variety of hot dog toppings, and their fries are GF and not fried in the same batter as glutenous items, and they are crisp and greasy goodness. They have burgers, and vegetarian items as well, I have tried a burger which was just so-so, however, the GF bun is something that really helps their appeal. If you are a hot dog lover, this is a must try.

I have been to this location on average of 2-3 times a week over a time span of 15 months.

My order of choice Dbl Steak Bowl.

I cannot speak of the beans because I usually only do that on Nachos.

The steak is in my experience always fresh but then I usually went between 1:30-6pm.

The vegetables always cut and cooked fresh.  I have NEVER had a bad experience at this location and only once over all my experiences.

The tea is literally tea brewed and yes fresh (may wanna get some ice though).  The lemons aren't sitting out for hours on end either.

Atmosphere kinda like Hollister and Abercombe type crowd.

They do serve beer, no wine.  Juice and milk at some locations as well.

Prices are fair in my opinion.  

Food is Healthy and no preservatives.

Staff are super friendly.  Seating well it's sort of fast food, but ya I usually had to go back to the office.  But I would eat there if I had the time.

The only set back is, this store is Not big enough for its location and the amount of people coming there.  Honestly if it was bigger, I think a lot more business would come.  Also the Lake Mary Blvd sign for this gold mine they have trees practically blocking the sign.  As a store owner I would want to fix it, but you can easily miss the turn if your not paying attention.

What kind of burrito argument is that?!?!

In my experience, Qdoba is often treated as an inferior alternative to Chipotle, but I digress. Two words: Queso burrito.

The queso burrito is one of the most magnificent fast food burrito options on the face of the planet. It's not the typical nacho cheese many expect from such an establishment -- it's the perfect blend of cheese, hotness, and gooey delight. The poblano pesto isn't bad either, but the queso burrito or the side of queso sauce is an option that, frankly, can't go wrong. (Unless you hate cheese or happy things, but hey.)

Also, the chips at Qdoba aren't there solely as vessels for carrying copious amounts of sea salt -- they're far tastier than other chain burrito chips.

If you're getting off at the 5th/6th and Oak MAX station or just in the area, give it a chance. You'll be delightfully surprised, and perhaps you can join Team Qdoba and fight the Chipotle hype!",2010-06-23 04:56:56

From a catering standpoint, they are quick but often times forget stuff for team functions.

Otherwise, I'm a little pissed that they raised their already overpriced meals, but it's so they can include stuff like guacamole and fajita veggies that they previously charged for.

I was in there last week.  Not by choice, to be sure (I had to be photographed eating a burrito for a comedy show).  I walked up to the counter and stood there while the cashier sat on the floor behind the register playing what I believe was a Nintendo DS.  He didn't look up once in the twenty or so seconds that I waited.  I didn't say anything, since I wasn't in a rush, and I kind of wanted to see how long he would play the video game before standing up and doing his job.

Eventually (he must've beaten a level or lost a life) he rose to his feet and placed his hands on the register.  I assumed this was my cue to order, so I asked for a bean and cheese burrito.  He typed in the order silently and then stood eyes down while I pulled the two dollars out of my pocket.

Much to my chagrin, I actually needed to take a bite out of the wretched concoction for sake of comedy.  It tasted like animal fur, and the bean and cheese mixture was exactly halfway between tepid and cold.

A fairly well-dressed man came in and stood at the counter as I was trying to swallow that bite and within a few seconds he began yelling at the cashier.  Apparently, he took the opposite approach that I did in trying to get his attention.  Whereas I decided to stand there and see how long it took for the kid to notice me, he opted to loudly explain that he wanted chicken and shouldn't be forced to wait by some lazy cashier.

This gentleman went as far as to ask the cashier yes or no questions repeatedly until the cashier answered:
""Should I have to wait to be served?  Well, SHOULD I HAVE TO WAIT?""
""No.""
""Are your video games more important than doing your job?  ARE THEY?""
""No.""
""Then take my *$*%@ order.""

By any standards you choose to measure, this was the worst food and the worst service I've ever received.  The only redeeming feature is that both the people that work there and the garbage they serve is bad enough to birth entertaining stories.",2008-03-03 20:01:55

I first went to when oh my, back in the, oh my I cant remember, as we have so many locations on the West side of Denver.
I knew this chain even before an IPO on the NASDAQ.
One of the reviewer said there were too many teens. Oh my. Let me just say, even though you are right about the teen scene at this location it doesn't even come close to the ""teen scene Flash mob"" that Happens 2 11am from the Arvada West Location in CO, opening just in time for teen lunch.. Good grief- they are good kids- but seriously.  ha ha
At this location- they are really good. If they don't get it right or your own miscommunication of what you wanted- no ""problemo"" to them. Also,  its done with no hesitation or foul attitude.
The employees are patient- and honestly are an excellent crew. The manager is great as well.
My mom left both the list and her cell phone at home when it was time for her to order she was at a loss- as to what everyone wanted. So the manager walked her back and let her use their phone. Now, that really is more customer service then from any typical chain.
And that is the next point. This is not a typical chain foodery. This is Colorado - (started around DU) where no body minds eating.
The Chili is GREEN Folks, Green,. Not red sauce mixed with some kinda beans and some kinda of meat- where it is sch-lop. This is NOT Tex Mex- where they try and fail at BBQ. This is not the traditional Southern BBQ either (which I love), but it is Sante Fe- style chili. The best ever. The red Chili is from dried Red Chili's and the Green is the always the fresh chili. A ""Christmas tree"" is half and half- and pretty good for the beginner.
This is a place that serves the more authentic Style Hatch chili (NM) using tomatillos and actually Chili's that grow on a vine. Cilantro is fairly gratuitous Corn, in this style is typically cooked IN THE husk. Get it? As we say out west ""No Schuck to the Husk!"". 
I will say here, there isn't any packs or bottles of  red or Green tobacco (green is my absolute Fav.) , or habenero hot sauces. But that is okay since I have some at home.
PS I think, the south and the islands call habenero ""Scotch Bonnets"". The fiery,  lil pumpkin orange , hot as hellp my mouth is burning chili.
Some one let me know for sure okays?

And this location is great for watching the world go by on Colonial Drive while you are having lunch. 
I stopped in yesterday while running around town. And I should have ran elsewhere.
All sub sandwiches come with mustard, mayo, tomato, lettuce, onion, and dill pickle. When I ordered my sandwich, I asked for just lettuce, tomato, mustard, and dill pickle, The cashier seemed to be put off by my request and asked why I didn't want it the way it is served. Shortly after ringing up my purchase and handing me my receipt and soda cup, I proceeded to get my chips and drink while the cashier took the next person's order.
There were only two other couples seated in the dining area. One couple was already eating while the other couple seated waited for their order. I went ahead and selected a table facing the television with the Rays-Yankees game and sat down to wait for my sandwich. 
And wait.
The couple that were waiting were soon served as the Firehouse Subs employee apologized to them for the wait.
Speaking of waiting, the guy who came in after me got his carry out order and left while I waited.
Then a young lady who the employees knew came in and they proceeded to have a conversation. While I waited.
Oh, and as I was waiting, another guy came in and picked up an order that he had called in for.
Nearly twenty minutes went by before I received my sub sandwich. And not even an apology for the wait.
I was not in a hurry. But having to wait twenty minutes for my meal after dealing with a cashier with a bad attitude rubs me the wrong way.
As I said, Firehouse Subs always makes a great sandwich. But having to wait for nearly twenty minutes when it is not busy is bad. I can understand if it is was busy, which it was not.
I will go to Firehouse Subs again. But not this location. My sandwich was good, but the service was not. If I am in the area again, which I will be, I will go somewhere else for lunch in Colonialtown.",2018-06-17 17:56:50

I asked to speak to a manager and was told that she was the manager. I asked for her name and she refused to give me it.

The woman behind the window was trying to start a fight with me, when I was nothing but kind and compassionate.  Being a 20 year old girl, the way she was acting was becoming increasingly frightening. I asked him for his name and he began using vulgarity.

At this point I feared for not only my safety, but for those around me. I drove off, and went across the street to the Walmart parking lot to call corporate.  I was seriously contemplating on calling the police, especially since I have the interaction on camera. The experience I had at this particular McDs was not only frightening, but absolutely unexceptable. I should not have to fear for my safety, especially over a hash brown and an iced coffee.

The employees I've encountered do not appear to be happy. I tried to order a Italian BMT and the person started making me a BLT. When I told her she made a mistake, she gave me a dirty look like it was my fault. Next I asked for house sauce on my sub. She put hot sauce.

But, alas, my office is in the mall. So on those days when I'm too lazy to bring lunch, I am forced to brave the debauchery that is the Lloyd Center food court. I am not for greasy or fast food, so that leaves me with four choices: Subway, Paradise Bakery, Jamba Juice, and Steamers.


At Steamers, I always get the combo plate, with 4 mushroom chicken dumplings, jasmine rice, and edamame. It's always satisfying and really healthy, especially by comparison to it's neighbors. 

It's not a destination spot for me, as in if I wasn't in the mall I would  never think: I want to drive to Steamers NOW!

So that means I have been frequenting this local Boloco much more often than before because I don't feel like I have inhaled Thanksgiving dinner after leaving there.

The Mexican Gumbo will turn your head forever.  Almost everyone that I've introduced it to has been astounded and become ""repeat offenders"" just like me.  Qdoba simply has the best tortilla soup (the base ingredient in the Gumbo) I've ever tasted. (I've ordered tortilla soup at every restaurant that has it on the menu in order to compare.)  The Gumbo offers the perfect blend of spice, tortilla soup, beans, rice, meat, salsa & cheese.  You can also add sour cream and guacamole.  You get to be the inventor of your own Gumbo as you fly through their line.  It is a hardy meal that fills you up. Everyone wants to try the burrito, or the nachos or the tacos... all good, but next time try the Gumbo!!! 

Here are my secrets:
1. Don't let them put rice in your gumbo, it soaks up all the tortilla soup and changes the consistency and taste.  If you must have the rice tell them to put it in a separate container.
2. Ask for all the salsa selections except the corn salsa and the super-hot (unless you like the burn).
3. Do order the guacamole and have them put it right in your Gumbo!
4. Get a side of chips and eat it with chips instead of a spoon.

In the mid-90s, some of my friends worked here while we all were students in high school. We used to hang out here and have fun. This always has been the closest Subway location to where my family has lived in Longwood since 1989. While I no longer go to it nearly as often as I did in the 90s and between 2000-2005 or so, it still is perfectly fine to go to every once in a while.

We had subs from here several months ago. Mine was very good. I usually just order the Veggie Delite or Veggie Patty sub. Never had a bad one at this Subway or any other. Might have to check out this store's breakfast sometime soon. The Subway near Princeton/Edgewater made some good breakfasts for me a few times. I'm hoping that this one will, too.

You have a lot of better lunch options nearby, as Luna's, Thai Delight, La Fonda, Papa B's and more small businesses are very close to, if not neighbors of, Subway. However, going to Subway once in a while is something I like to do.

My main issue with Subway is that they no longer do that stamp program. I would be here A LOT if the stamps still were used. Not sure why they discontinued that. Oh, well.",2012-12-31 16:24:50

Chicago Mustards: you get a perfect, steaming hot juicy Polish sausage made for you by a guy who heaps playful insults at you the entire time he's cooking.  Cost: Maybe $2.50.  You also get to have a milkshake made for you right there out of whichever flavors of ice cream you want.

Boulder Mustards: Some polite sucker behind the counter makes a relatively dry Polish sausage, acts surprised when you ask for peppers, and charges you $4.99 for it.  No milkshakes.  You're surrounded by people eating veggie burgers... veggie burgers at Mustards??  THAT IS WRONG.  You get so enraged that you decide to go eat by the creek.  The polite dude offers you a rental blanket, which you snatch from him.

The chicken and steak are my favorites.  The ""barbacoa"" is not traditional by any means, it's more like shredded brisket and the carnitas are usually overly salty.

The pizza is okay right out of the oven, though there is a real imbalance in flavor which it took me a couple of times to analyze:  it's the garlic powder.  Waaay too much of it, this cheap garlic powder.  And well, everything about this pizza is kind of cheap: the sauce, the flour...  and while most pizza gets better in flavor overnight, this one somehow manages  to become downright inedible.

Now, mind you, all the ingredients of a burrito bowl are printed as big as Dallas on the signage behind the employees. Despite this convenience, the female building my bowl seems really really lost. When she was handed my bowl by the ordering dude, she just stood there looking down into the vast ingredient choices. And stood there some more. Finally I says I'll take, steak, rice, pinto beans, and some peppers and onions. She puts some in. Then guess what? Yeah, she stares back down in the food and stands there.

In my experience, probably 80-90% of them at least say ""sir"" and ""thank you"" and ""have a good day,"" if not with a smile, than at least in a friendly fashion.  

But Chick-fil-a takes it a step further.  I don't know if they train the employees to be super-polite, or if they just tend to hire friendly people, but it shows.  I really like how they say ""my pleasure"" instead of ""you're welcome.""  It lends a bit of Southern class to the transaction.  As far as service goes, is there another fast-food place that hires a worker specifically to take people's trays and offer refills?  I doubt it.

All of that would be moot if the food wasn't good, but it's perfect.  How they get the chicken to be so juicy and flavorful, I don't know, but it puts all other fast-food chicken sandwiches to shame (including McDonald's ""Southern-style"" sandwich, a pathetic attempt at a ripoff).  I get the regular breaded sandwich with extra pickles and dip it in buffalo sauce, and there are very few foods I'd rather eat, especially in the realm of fast food.  The waffle fries, too, are among the best fries available, with tons of potato flavor, and the shape is perfect for scooping up copious quantities of ketchup.  Chick-fil-a serves some of the best lemonade in town as well.

I did try the new spicy sandwich a couple of months ago, and while it was delicious, it left me in intestinal agony for a good 36 hours.  But my stomach is growing more and more sensitive to spicy foods as I get older, so that's just me... hopefully your experience will be better.

If I had to find something to complain about, it's that they offer ketchup only by the packet.  If you use as much ketchup as I do on your fries, every meal here will begin with three or four minutes of opening and squeezing. 

I can't really complain about them being closed on Sundays, because I understand why they do it and it's very admirable.  It just seems like every time I get a strong craving for Chick-fil-a, it's Sunday.",2010-10-04 18:26:51

More thoughts: 
I've had their slices and ordered pizzas different times, and we have enjoyed the freshly made pizzas a little more, so if you're going to get a few slices, I'd recommend ordering a whole pizza! 

This place is our go-to for pizza on a night we don't feel like cooking, and it's perfect for us because it's close to our apartment.

I've eaten there a few times simply because it's on my way home from work, it's cheap, and fast food staffs have a lot of turnover so there's a chance it'll be better. 

The Taco Bell fare is horribly assembled, sometimes half out of the tortilla. The folks working there can barely even stuff a burrito supreme. Further, the freshness of the veggies and the tortillas is horrible, even by Taco bell standards. 

The KFC is just plain mediocre, even by KFC standards. My chicken sandwich was memorable--memorable does not always mean good. 

True, there's the flying car problem: build a flying car, and it probably won't fly as well as an airplane or drive as well as a car. The more things something is designed to do, the worse it's going to be at any given one of them. Thus, this probably won't be the world's best KFC or the world's best Taco Bell; however, If the product isn't too bad, selection and convenience can count for a lot.

Baja Fresh is a really good burrito, especially for a franchise.  If Baja Fresh and Chipotle had a fight, Baja would wipe the floor with those sloppy Chipotle dweebs.

This location like others has undergone remodeling, ditching the bland interior for something you actual might want to eat in; glass, TV, a fireplace, pseudo-upscale seating attempting to stem the loss of clientele by the fast-causal competition. All this is nice but is ultimately worthless if fundamentals are lacking. 

In my trip here fundamentals were lacking. 

1.) All the pleasing interior designs in the world will fail if much of a customer's experience is spent watching the employees work in their miserable assembly line of bells, whistles and alarms.  This is due when the line overwhelms the system and the customer ( that's me on this trip) has to stand and wait for his food, doing nothing but watching the staff hustle among their machines and food parts.  How about a number system where we could at least enjoy the new fancy dining room instead of standing and feeling odd? 

2.) The cashiers need to listen: I said ""for here,"" not ""to go."" I was forced to just eat out of the bag. This is not a critical error, and if it wasn't busy I would had corrected at the counter. But it is a pet peeve and something so simple.

3.) Nothing says low quality than the soda machine having no ice and for the soda to be hooked-up wrong and be flat. Uggg.

4.) though not all that bad, the place was pretty dirty with crumbs in the carpet and straw wrappers tossing about like tumbleweeds.

The slice of pizza is pretty large and quite good for what it is. The crust is actually very good and the rest of the toppings are decent as well.

What I like about this place is that they just serve you lukewarm pizza, rather than putting it in the over for a couple minutes--which to me just makes it too hot and oily to eat.

However, I'd probably go there more often than I do if not for a few problems:

1) Price (expensive).  I get the ""orginal"" size classic Mexican burrito with extra steak and it comes out to over $8.  A burrito is supposed to be a classic low-priced food, being about 75% rice and beans.  And for $8, you have other quality options for a filling lunch.  This leads me to the next problem:

2) Portion size (inconsistant/small).  I wouldn't complain about price if I felt like I was getting my $8 worth, but such is not usually the case.  The ""original"" is really their largest size, so it should be more than filling, but it's not - not even with the extra steak.  That is, half of the time, since sometimes they load it up and sometimes they don't, depending on who is working there.  I'm a hungry 6'1 adult with a healthy appetite, so I'm sensitive to when they're stingy on the filling, especially when they skimp on the extra meat that I paid for. 

3) Erring on the less-spicy side.  I love spicy foods so I always ask for extra habanero salsa on my burrito, since this is supposedly their spiciest salsa.  Yet they usually manage to go so stingy on this that I can barely even taste any hotness at all.  Come on, people, it's Mexican food!  It's supposed to be spicy!  Especially when someone asks for it!  On that note, most of their burrito menu options are not really burritos, but random burrito-like wraps with odd flavors.  It's good to have options - I understand that - but then less attention is paid to the REAL burritos in terms of tasting authentic!

So, go to Boloco if you want an $8 burrito with a selection of various trendy, yuppy flavors.  If you want a legitimate spicy Mexican burrito that can fill you up when you're really hungry, you might want to try one of the many competitors.",2013-08-01 21:26:43

I've been working in the area for over a year and the food choices, including those in the old mall, were truly pathetic. Due to lack of options I got to know the fine folks at Starbucks and Togo Sushi very, very well. 

With that in mind, words fail to describe how psyched I was when I found out my downtown lunch favourite, Freshii, was opening in the new food court - finally, a healthy lunch option with vegetables! Lots of vegetables! Though it wasn't ready on the mall's opening day, it's now up and running so I popped by today to grab my favourite Cobb salad. Bonus: I had worked my way up to a free salad on my stamp card.

This Freshii has most of the same selections of salads, soups, burritos/wraps, and bowls as the other locations. Everything is made fresh (no grabbing a pre-made and pre-mixed salad out of a cooler), and like the other locations, you have the option of adding proteins (tofu, chicken, etc), substituting quinoa for brown rice, adding kale, etc. One major difference between this location and the others though is that you can't custom make your order from scratch. I don't know if this is a logistical thing, given that it's in a food court, or if they're planning on phasing that in later, but just be warned if you were hoping to go and build your own fancy schmancy salad.

Unfortunately, right now it is painfully apparent that the staff are new and untrained. Service was slower than normal, and a lot of the staff didn't seem to know yet how to put the food together and run the till. However, they bought in the lovely district manager from the Cordova location to help out (he's really a gem) so I'm sure it will  improve as everyone gets more used to things.  I'll be interested to see how well it does in the coming months given that it's a touch pricier than a regular food court place (about $10 for a salad, including tax), and that its the only location in BC right now located outside of the tony west side/downtown of Vancouver, in a 'burb.",2013-08-30 21:12:13

The interior is always clean, play area included. I get extra dipping sauces without even having to ask. They'll bring my food to my table, they stand outside with their little iPads and take orders, they've even brought my food out to my car before I've even hit a window.

I'm not alone.  In my table of 4, not one of us had a good meal.  It had nothing to do with the service, it had nothing to do with the atmosphere, it was simply the quality of the food.  You can get better barbeque at TONS of places not only in the country, but in this very zip code!  I mean, the nearby chains of Sonny's and Bubbalou's for instance have far better barbeque.

  Most of us had the barbeque pork sampler so we could try a little bit of everything.  The spare ribs were incredibly tough.  The smoked sausage tasted like any typical American sausage that you could get at any breakfast establishment like IHOP.  The toast was dry, the barbeque sauce was nothing special, and the side dishes were horrible. (green beans and sweet potato) The only part of the meal that could be considered ""average"" would be the pulled pork and the sliced pork.  I've had far better though.  Also, the corn nuggets for appetizer weren't bad, but nothing special and certainly no reason to rush over there.   

For half of what I paid, I could have gone to Sonny's and gotten all you can eat of better sliced pork that was actually tasty rather than bland.  Honestly, with everything, I had to drench it in barbeque sauce.  The only reason Woody's gets two stars is because the friendly service.  But, the food is at the core here and they need to be able to back up the good service with some at least decent food.

They have a lot of great local produce topped on the pizza.  Just one slice of the Focaccia Veggie will fill me up.  The breadsticks are long and huge.  Just having one can easily be shared by 2 people.  Combine it with a slice of pizza and you will be full.  

You also have a variety selection of great beers to buy, or wine if you like too.  One of the best things about this place is their home made soda.  Flavors change once in a while and the raspberry soda is my favorite.  It is available on tap and it has a great sweet finish to it.  You can also buy them in bottles and at various ""Made in Oregon stores"".

I have celiac disease, so I was excited when a coworker mentioned seeing a dedicated gluten-free restaurant in downtown Vancouver. I went for lunch with a friend, and both of us were disappointed.

I ordered the chicken nori wrap salad, fresh juice, and two small chocolates. I was surprised when the fellow at the register, rather than making the food fresh, instructed me to pick up the salad and juice from the refrigerator, where it had been sitting for who knows how long.

The nori wrap was soggy, the salad dressing was boring, and the spinach was bruised and mushy. Someone had obviously grabbed a handful from a bag of pre-washed spinach, without visually inspecting it for damage.

The juice (I ordered blueberry-something) was okay, but startlingly uninspired. Jugo Juice is better.

For this taste extravaganza, I paid nearly $25.

At least the chocolate (chili-chai) was good. Maybe because the chocolate wasn't made by Smak.

However, the cashier was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, and clarified that everything is gluten-free, with possible gluten cross-contamination labelled on the menu: a curry made with a spice mix from India that is not certified gluten-free, and certified gluten-free oatmeal that they warn avenin-sensitive celiacs about.

However, that doesn't explain why they have wheat grass on their menu. Why a dedicated gluten-free restaurant, that caters to people with celiac disease and wheat allergies, has wheat grass on the premises is beyond me.

Also, everything is served in plastic containers. Thankfully Smak recycles, but this seems more wasteful than simply washing cutlery and dishes.

I wonder if Smak's hot menu options might be better than their embarrassingly bad salads. If I'm in the area again, I might be willing to try their chicken curry or barbecue pork.

Their slices aren't cheap - if you want something other than plain cheese or pepperoni, we're talking $8 for two slices! (Because seriously, when does one slice of pizza make a meal?) 

The ingredient combinations are sometimes brilliant, but sometimes more hokey than inventive... for example, on my last visit I had a Waldorf- apple slices and walnuts on an olive oil base. It was about the blandest slice of pizza I've ever had, and even after a re-warming session in the oven, it still tasted like it had been sitting there for hours. Hot Lips? Quite a misnomer. I'd have to shake that pepper flake thingy right into my mouth to feel any real heat. 

The PSU location in particular has started to irritate me when I go there. The staff is indifferent and can't be bothered to crack a smile. Plus, for a pizza place located on a college campus, they should also really have more than one power outlet. 

I don't know. Maybe I'm becoming a grouchy old lady, but I'm bored with Hot Lips. The novelty of the whole ""We have fresh and unusual ingredients! We compost!"" has worn off, because you can't walk half a block in this town without passing another restaurant that is singing the same tune.

I'm not a big fan of sandwiches, but when I have a choice between Subway or Quiznos, I would always choose Quiznos.  Sure, their sandwiches cost more than Subway's, but Quiznos toasted sandwiches are just so much more flavorful and delicious!  I tend to stick with the white bread, and my favorite sandwiches are:

* Baja Chicken with bacon, cheddar, BBQ sauce, and chipotle mayo (no onions; add lettuce and tomatoes)
* Mesquite Chicken with bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, and ranch (no onions)

However, I haven't had a Quiznos sandwich in quite some time.  So what do I order most often from this sandwich shop?  Salads, specifically chicken salads.  Currently, a large chicken salad from Quiznos costs $5.99 (pre-tax).  That's the best deal for a ""fast food"" chicken salad you can get in the area - at least that I know of (walking-distance from the office, of course).

Until they suddenly discontinued the Cobb Salad a few months ago, that was my usual salad.  Basically, they no longer have hard-boiled eggs as a topping, so they can't make it anymore.  Boo.

Since they did away with the Cobb Salad, my new favorite salad is the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad with mixed greens, tomatoes, mushrooms, green bell peppers, and just a few croutons. I ask for the BBQ ranch dressing on the side and also add bacon.  Recently, I found out that you can have the chicken and bacon ""warmed up"" in the toaster if you don't want your usual cold chicken in your salad!  This salad is delicious, but I try to use the most minimal amount of BBQ ranch dressing since it's obviously not the healthiest of salad dressings.  (Note: Balsamic vinaigrette is usually my favorite salad dressing, but Quiznos' version is NOT good.  It is way too dark, sweet, and syrupy, not like your usual balsamic vinaigrette.)

On cold days or whenever I feel like having soup with my salad, I order the ""Choose 2"" for $5.99.  You can select two of either a salad, cup of soup, or grilled flatbread.  I think it's a great deal for a small salad and soup (or flatbread).  This location only serves Chicken Noodle and Broccoli Cheese soups.  I always choose the Broccoli Cheese, which is very good.

Although turnover here seems to be high, the manager and one long-time employee are always very friendly and quick at making sandwiches and salads.  I know it's because I go there so often, but I really appreciate that they remember my usual salad order.  =)

Overall, this Quiznos gets 4 stars for their tasty toasted sandwiches and fresh, affordable salads!  On weekdays, I usually go at either 11:30 am or 1 pm to avoid the lunch crowd, so I am rarely in there for more than 5 minutes or so.  As long as I am working in the area, I will continue to frequent this Quiznos!

Tip: Sign up for Quiznos Q Club for emails containing printable coupons.  There is frequently a coupon for $1 off ""Regular or Large Sandwich or Large Salad,"" and this location is always happy to accept them!",2015-02-25 01:35:56

A person I believe was a manager was at the grill and looked at me several times without saying a word. I should add that the restaurant was not very crowded at all. It was obvious that I was there to place an order but no one said a single word. After the manager looked at me for the fourth time I got fed up and said, ""Is someone going to help me?!"" He looked put off by this as if I was inconveniencing him. Seeing as how I wasn't going away he rolled his eyes and yelled to the back kitchen and asked if anyone could help me. That was probably best since he didn't appear trained in human interaction or social graces. If you like being ignored and appreciate crappy service, this is the place to go for a meal.

Don't come here for that reason.

As a neighborhood slice, I would have given two more stars if this was in.....Chelmsford....or Fitchburg, but in Boston, there are better neighborhood slices.

Oh and maybe to satisfy another reviewer, they had changed the dough recipe before I got there. I say that because the review says ""too thin"", one flaw not present in my sampling in comparison to a New York pie. No, mine was bready, with way too much cheese, like they were trying to both appeal to locals and approximate a New York pie, which in some markets is an irreconcilable conflict. Like trying to open up a place making genuine Boston style in Athol, MA. The original recipe would last six months tops before it had to change to please the locals.

It was ok.

During a lunch break, we went back and I ordered the Downtown Dahl Curry, it was actually good.  I didn't know what to expect as I don't eat that much lentils and was wondering about their SMAK rice, since it is gluten free.  

On the Sunday of that weekend, I ordered the Red Veg Curry Bowl.  There is just a hint of spice to it although I eat a lot of spicy food so my tolerance for spicy food maybe higher.

That being said, our visit wasn't too bad. We were promptly seated and given waters. I will say, there was only one server on the floor on a Saturday around 8pm so if you come at the wrong time, the wait can be a bit ridiculous.

Luckily they usually put down the check when they deliver food (you pay up front) because we were pretty much left alone after that. 

Food wise, it's a slight step above traditional fast food. The frisco melt is the star in my opinion. Thin fries are good if you actually get them hot. Chicken fingers are cheap. The milkshakes are usually decent, we tried butterfinger and peanut butter chocolate this time and couldn't finish them because they are so big.

I started out getting a snack of curry (vegetarian) & rice. It was only $2 so I figure it was worth a try on a cold day. It was pretty good, reminded me of golden curry, and not a bad way to fill up quickly if you're short on time. There will be slightly less curry in the $2 cup than if you order the $4.50 bowl, I am told. I suggested possibly offering some more veggies to the menu for those vegetarians & health food freaks who are forced to come with fried-chicken loving friends and significant others. The owner said he understands that it might be something they can do on the side if someone asks for it, since the franchise requires that the menu only lists certain things. 

One thing they are doing is having more summer cold drinks coming, in addition to what's on the menu, which is great. I'm told there will be the ability to adjust your sugar levels with those. 

So rest assured, my fellow veggie-philes, I've forged the way and trailblazed a path forward for us...in a fried chicken joint.

I can relax now. While McDonald's was once the primary investor in this franchise, they are no more! As of 2006, Chipotle is back to being company-owned (as are Donato's Pizza and Boston Market). So, I can now get my massive burrito fix guilt-free! 

With that said, once you have the good fortune of living near a Chipotle Mexican Grill, it's really hard to live somewhere you can't get your hands on one of their big fat burritos! It may not be the most authentic Mexican food around, but the meat and produce is as fresh as it comes. hence their motto: ""Food with integrity."" 

From the start, the company's philosophy has been to deal with local growers and use unprocessed, seasonal, family-farmed, sustainable, nutritious, naturally raised, added hormone free and organic products when possible. This really shines through in the final product and flavors, which is why Chipotle remains uber-successful. 

The Kingsdale location is quite often overrun with high-school students, but don't let the long lines scare you away. The assembly-line service is usually very quick. Most patrons are pro's at the protocol of ordering. 

The menu is limited to a variety of burritos, tacos and burrito bowls- but you can have your toppings a thousand different ways. Just place your order at the counter and the line of servers will custom build a burrito to your specifications. Just pick your protein then walk them through the toppings, which include all the usual suspects: rice, beans, guacamole, sour cream, cheese and grilled fajita vegetables. Three types of salsa are available and each one is different and delicious. 

Most of my friends go straight for ""five pound"" burrito, because they love everything stuffed into its overflowing shell, but the burrito BOWL is my favorite. The meat and veg are served in a bowl without the tortilla shell. Perfect for anyone watching their carb-intake. (Do people still do that?). Trust me. Shell or no shell, you'll get your $6 worth! 

The soda fountain is serve yourself and this particular location offers a few different Mexican beers and bottled margaritas. There are a few tables outside, albeit overlooking the Kingsdale parking lot.

The place was a little on the dirty side. Not like homeless people and filth, like restaurant where the tables are not wiped or the floors swept quite often enough. As this was my first experience in Portland, I thought the staff looked and dressed a bit. . . odd. Not in an off-putting way; after all, I live in the hipster capital of Chicago. But over the course of the weekend I came to realize everyone in Portland looked like that. They were friendly.

I started with a slice and a blackberry soda. The pizza was something with sausage and feta cheese and some other stuff. It was yummy! And the soda was delicious. They sell their various fruit sodas by the bottle. If I had realized there was a fridge in my hotel room at that point, I would have bought several to enjoy over the weekend. I was still hungry so I got another slice, this one vegetarian with garlic, mushrooms and potatoes (yes, potatoes). There was maybe just a tiny touch too much garlic, but overall it was surprisingly good! Potatoes on pizza.  . who knew?

When I first arrived in Wellesley, I was underwhelmed by the selection of Mexican joints. Sure, there was Anna's and Chipotle but I didn't like the taste or their selection of salsas/sauces.

Then, I found Qdoba off of Linden Street. Not only is this bad boy located in a great location (next to Bank of America, across from a great Roche Bros/CVS/Starbucks), the traffic here indicates how much the locals and college students love this joint.

The food is always fresh. You see them prepare it. They customize your every order just how you want it. They always ask the same questions (unless you are a regular then they ""know"" which is always great) to make sure they didn't leave anything out. The people that prepare the food have been there for years and are awesome.

In terms of traffic, try to avoid the lunch and dinner traffic because the line can back up all the way to the door. You'd think most people would leave but they don't. You can't leave when you know that 650 calorie burrito of deliciousness waiting for you (yeah, I love Mexican food). Besides the quality of food, low price, and excellent service, the thing that tops it off is the Cholula sauce. Last time I checked, neither Anna's nor Chipotle had it (nor will I ever need to check).

Okay, I get it, you're by Fenway Park.. but c'monnn. On the flipside, it makes the $5 foot long an even better deal than it usually is (otherwise you save like 20 cents if you're getting the veggie delite), so ask them to wrap that other half and eat it for dinner!  

A couple quirks about this Subway.. about every other time I've come in.. they've run out of something. Not something I ever want since I usually get the veggie sandwich and they'd have to run out of vegetables to eff that up, but there's usually one thing missing (certain chicken styles or meat cuts). Their chip selection is gross (IE - most of the time it's just Fritos) which I kind of find unacceptable considering their push for the ""fit"" meal that includes baked chips for adults AND kids. Service during the weekdays is as fast as it can be with two sandwich makers who are also ringing up orders. I give them props for handling the lines.. but hey management.. throw them a bone! I mean you ARE charging more than the other Subways in the area. Other quirks worth mentioning include: being overcharged for the meals (hey 20-50 cent overcharges adds up over time.. think about the economy!) and the soda pumps being hooked up incorrectly (as in.. if it tastes like coke.. even if it's coming out of a diet coke pump.. it's probably coke). 

This place usually isn't a clusterf*ck when I go... like all these things don't happen at once.. but something always happens. Then again.. could just be me and my Eeyore like rain cloud that occasionally follows me to restaurants. 

This place is bright and relatively clean. Like I said.. there are two workers most of the time but people usually clean up after themselves.

It had fried onion and BBQ sauce. I brought it back up and they looked at the slip and said it was Pico Guac. I told them to look at the sandwich and they then realized I was right. I watched as three woman in the back went back in forth with different ingredients yelling in Spanish attempting to make me the correct sandwich. When it was done the manager(?) asked me to look at it to see if it was right! Don't they even know what goes on their own sandwich creations? I always though McDonald's had extensive training programs for just this stuff. As if this was not bad enough the two woman that had helped me were completely rude.

I created a yelp account specifically because this place infuriated me so much.

I ordered last night through foodler. I had ordered a half and half pizza but since there was no way to add toppings to a cheese pizza, I had to start with a pepperoni pizza. The final result seemed confusing. So, I called and was super nice and quick in explaining what I wanted.. a pizza with pepperoni on the whole thing and half with onions, mushrooms, hamburg and sausage also. I also ordered a garden salad with romaine instead of iceberg. 

I have been in the restaurant business forever and made sure that when I ordered online, I did so correctly. I made sure I was charged for all the toppings and that they not only had romaine lettuce but that their ceasar was the same price as the garden salad so that I wasn't requesting to substitute a more expensive item. I went out of my way to order correctly and to not annoy or confuse the people working there.

The very first thing the guy on the phone did was get completely annoyed that I ""typed my order into the comments"" so I wouldn't have to pay for my toppings. I am not a scammer or a complete moron so of course I had not. He said he would have to call me back with a new total after he put in the order. Thats funny, because this pizza was already $18. I assured him that I was charged for all the toppings but said if he needed to call back, I would be available.  He did not.

Then 2 hours go by. Still no pizza. I called in and the guy that answered the phone sounded shocked that I had waited two hours, he seemed to kinda care. Then he handed the phone to someone else (I think the guy who I originally called the first time) who answered ""New York Pizza"" like I had not just spoken to someone else. I again, nicely told him I had ordered two hours ago and all he said was, ""So do you still want the pizza""? He told me he had never rang it in. I was BLOWN AWAY by his indifference. I would normally never ASK someone for an apology but I was truly in shock. I said that I did still want it but that any sort of apology would be nice, I mean it was Sat night and I had plans later and was about to wait at least 2.5 hours for a pizza. I was very nice about it. WAY TOO NICE in fact. He gave me a very lackluster ""sorry Ill get it there asap""

About 40 min later the food arrives. Full price, no apology, no extra cookie, nothing. 

The pizza was DISGUSTING. Slightly undercooked, but would not have been any better had it been cooked anyway. The low quality meat toppings including the albino sausage turds reminded me of chewy dog treats. Remember snausages? Thats what this pizza smelled like. After gagging on a couple of bites, I picked all of the meat off. My friend refused to eat it at all. To call it NY pizza is laughable, as it is barely passable as edible. The sauce was EXACTLY like the sauce on red baron frozen pizzas. Abnormally smooth and kind of sweet. Its amazing I could even tell though, because there was very little sauce on the pizza at all. It was also the size of 4 NY slices, and again $18.

What sent me over the edge though was the salad. It was not only iceberg, not a leaf of romaine, but it was torn iceberg on the bottom, then carrots, cabbage, olives and pepperoncinis on top of that, then a giant fucking tuft of shredded, taco like, iceberg on top of that. REALLY NY PIZZA? YOU CANT MAKE A PIZZA, AND YOU CANT MAKE A REASONABLE APOLOGY FOR SOMEONE WAITING ALL NIGHT FOR THAT SHITTY PIZZA, BUT YOU ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH TEXTURES IN YOUR SALAD USING ICEBERG LETTUCE!!!!???  WHAT A JOKE!!!!

UGH, I'm getting more annoyed just thinking about it. I cannot possibly imagine that this place ever serves good food. You can tell when you just order the wrong thing or when the place has absolutely no hope. This is definitely the latter. Save your money and go anywhere else.",2012-12-02 17:48:27

Had an early dinner on Friday, so I was heading home about 10pm and had a craving for a good cheeseburger and fries.  Being mindful of what I eat at all times, this is kind of a rarity for me.  I figured if I was going to do something wrong, I should do it right!  That said, I skipped the idea of McDonald's or Wendy's and went for Steak n Shake.

Damnit.  

Ordered the Classic Double combo with a strawberry milkshake.  First thing, while the girl manning the drive thru was certainly nice enough, she had me pull off to the side to wait for my food, which she would bring out to me.  Seven or eight minutes later she comes out.  Didn't open the bag until I got home.

So I live one mile from this location on Emerald/Britton, got back to the house pretty fast.  Opened up my order to find what can only be described as a flat cheeseburger frisbee with the world's largest piece of lettuce.  Lopsided, a giant slice of pickle sticking out from both ends...just...wow.  Did I mention the lettuce was brown?  Yep, no lie.  Spotted, browned...that weird reddish color at the end of the leaf-I took pictures and tweeted them to the company's account. 

I'm a sucker for good food, but I've never been one to complain if it's not unless something REALLY bugs me.  I realize I'm not going to get perfection from a fast food joint, but this just bothered me.  In fact, this is my first YELP review.

The cashiers were nice and helpful both times I went but the atmosphere was a little stiff - the second time I went I think the owners/staff were having their own meeting at a table nearby. It felt a little awkward, especially because there were not a lot of people inside the place. 

Anyways, re: food, I have tried the mango salad (mini for $6.85), summer stew ($9.65) and the salmon (lox) box ($11.85) The salad was ok, the stew was decent but small, the lox salmon was good but the ""nori"" seaweed wrap was not very impressive. It was very small and not wrapped very well. Also tried the ""bliss juice"" ($6.85) which basically is a mix of beets, pineapple, lemon juice cucumber, celery and apple juice blended together. 

I really did want to like this place because there aren't a whole lot of other ""togo""
healthy food options nearby (except freshii on west georgia and bute) but after trying this place twice, I wasn't impressed enough to go back.

Bottom line: Kind of average tasting and too expensive. I would have given 3 stars if prices were lower. Small portions in general, had to eat another meal both times after eating here.
Suggestion: lower prices, e.g. perhaps make combos of the boxes + juices for $10",2013-07-11 19:47:43

After a few trips to Five Guys their shortcomings became apparent to me and fortunately the market caught up and I had other places to go.

Fast forward to now and Orange City has a Five Guys. I was spending time at the hospital across the street and thought I would give this relatively new location a try. The first thoughts I had were that this conversion from what looks to have been a Hardees suited Five Guys well. Lots of seating and far less of the chaos found in Altamonte.

The burgers were ok, I'm not a fan of the seeded buns and I don't like American cheese...at all. You can imagine that I wasn't happy after ordering Swiss cheese and getting American slapped on my burger that first, not getting it and second not even realizing it wasn't an option (as the server never mentioned it) made me even more frustrated. Adding to my misery, there are no other choices for sides except for French Fries (in insanely large portions) leads me to the conclusion that I'm not a fan of Five Guys no matter where the location is. Some people locally compare Burger-Fi to Five Guys and its an unfair comparison. Burger-Fi is obviously superior on all levels (they really are competing in different markets and quality levels) and perhaps people should compare Five Guys to the newly improved Wendy's burgers. Personally, I prefer the Wendy's burgers head to head. The price is better, the French fry portions are not so obnoxious, the buns are to my preference, I can get more variety in cheese and the burgers are equally tasty...all in my opinion of course but that's why we are here, right?",2013-01-21 03:34:30

But many times they are compacted, sad and greasy looking and i feel bad for the cow that gave it's life and ended up like this. And, from my experience, the staff at this Wendy's seem to be in a worse and slower-moving mood than at the great, luminous Rally's right up the street.

This location gets super busy at lunch (as do most lunch places downtown).  The staff there does keep the line moving and they are fast.  I won't say efficient because, well, they did the worst thing possible. 

I'm a vegetarian and they meated me.

I think because of their super-fast speed, they must have flung a piece of meat (I don't even know what it was, but I know it wasn't chicken) into the beans or something which eventually ended up in my burrito.  Or who knows maybe someone was scooping meat out and over my burrito to someone else's next to me, but either way meat got onto my burrito.  So as I'm starving because I ended up taking lunch a lot later than normal and I'm halfway through my burrito when I bite down on something that hasn't been in my mouth for over 10 years.  Gross.  I spit it out and tried to not freak out but it was so fucking gross.  

It would be absolutely ignorant of me to think that in my 10+ years of being a vegetarian I haven't accidentally, unknowingly ingested some type of animal product, whether by broth or something else like that.  But that was the first time I have actually had flesh in my mouth in a long time.  

It was so disgusting that even though I usually love their food, I have a hard time stomaching the thought of giving them another try.  That may have ruined me not only for that location, but all locations.  If I ever do go back, it won't be for a very very long time.

I'm sorry Boloco, but if you claim to be veggie-friendly, then you better be sure you aren't cross-contaminating, and even worse, getting MEAT in a meat-less burrito.  Your employees are the face of your company's customer service and if they are careless enough to let meat fall where it shouldn't, then I can only imagine what else they have overlooked.",2010-10-01 02:41:50

The portion size was good for a big eater (I ordered the full size). Lots of sauce, the SMAK rice is great (seems to be a mix of rice and beans?), and I am not hungry again (it's been 3 hours) so I'd say job well done.

For six weeks I had to use crutches to get anywhere, so of course I went to as few places as possible. Of course this meant lots and lots of cheap delivery food (which I'm certain contributed to my speedy and full recovery). The Cluckwich (A sandwich of a large breaded chicken patty, covered in wing sauce on a kaiser roll with blue cheese, lettuce and tomato) became my basic unit of food, and two months later I went through the most severe withdraw of my life. Yes, worse than the time I had my wisdom teeth out and got ever-so-slightly addicted to oxycotin. You read that right; I am saying the Cluckwich is more addictive than oxy.

Two years later, I moved off campus into an apartment on the same street as Cluck-U, four blocks down. But by this time, they had introduced an item to their menu that managed to trump even the might Cluckwich: The Sloppy. A Sloppy is a couple chicken tenders, again covered in their unbelieveably good buffalo wing sauce. This time, it's on a hoagie roll, but with french fries and (if you're smart enough to order it) cole slaw. Food this terrible for you shouldn't be this good, but somehow is.

I also want to give a special shout out to their remarkable delivery service. In a town where most delivery people won't go much more than ten blocks, Cluck U has driven nearly three miles to bring fried chicken to me at the St. James Tavern, when I was too inebriated to pick it up myself (I don't usually order their more traditional items like the fried chicken breasts, but there's nothing like grease and chicken to soak the booze out of you). And they take delivery orders until 3:45 AM.

Cluck U is the pinnacle of fast food. If I was about to be executed, a Buffalo Sloppy Slaw sandwich would be my last meal.",2008-04-04 07:11:51

We sat down to eat the meal and just as we are about to leave we see a group of employees come out to eat and they all have heaping bags of chips. I don't know about anyone else, but if you are telling the customers you are out of ships it is ridiculous for those same people to now come out with overly filled bags of chips.

The location is close to my house, so I've stopped by for ice cream from time to time.  It's a little bit pointless to review a McDonald's based on its food, because you know what you're getting there.  Instead, let's focus on the staff, drive-thru, and dining space.

On the plus side, this place had a 100 (A) health rating the last time I looked.  Honestly, I was shocked.  The outside is pretty dated and the interior seemed clean but had that old grimy feel you get in places that haven't been updated in a while.

The staff is pretty good, in the sense that they are nice.  I haven't had any bad encounters here, and they try to do a good job from what I can tell.

Now, to the downsides.  First, the drive-thru line is incredibly, inconceivably, dreadfully, interminably slow.  It's the worst of any McDonald's I've ever seen.  Actually, it's the worst drive-thru I've ever seen period.  No matter the time of day, it's always packed with cars and it takes FOREVER.  I think there must be some kind of time warp, or wormhole into the multiverse or something.  I don't know how it's possible for a window to take so long.  After that, half the time your order is wrong even though it appears on the screen to verify.  It's inexcusable.

The last time I tried to visit was at 2:30am on a Sunday night after a flight.  You guessed it - there were at least 10 cars backed up (I'm not exaggerating here).  I said screw-it and went to bed hungry.

The next issue is the interior of the place.  It's just old and kind of gross.  They have a fine health rating but it's not appetizing to sit and eat here.  Go to an updated McDonald's for a better experience.

Overall, I can't give this place much of a recommendation.  The only thing keeping it from getting one star are the staff.",2015-12-04 18:50:58

A couple days ago, at 1130P, I tried to pick myself up a McFlurry after work. The McDonald's is right across the street from the hotel I'm staying at so I walked. Despite having dine-in hours that went till 12A, the doors were locked. I walked over to the drive-thru window and asked if I could go in and I was told the dining area was closed (despite people clearly eating inside and, again, it supposedly being open for another half hour). So I ask at the window if I can order there and they say ""no,"" it's for drive-thru only. So I ask why the dining area is closed a half hour early and she shuts the window on me!

Fast forward to two days later and I'm still craving a McFlurry. So I try this McDonalds again but this time I get there at 1030P. And guess what? The doors were locked again! And again, there were people clearly dining inside so it's not like the interior was shut down for renovations or something like that. The just chose to close the dine-in area 90 minutes early. Now I did have a car with me this time but there were 6 cars already in the drive-thru line and I wasn't going to wait that long for a $2 McFlurry. So I went to I-Hop and got a milkshake instead.

The first time I went to this place, I ordered the buff chicken pizza.  Usually the pizza is cold and they put it in the oven to heat it up until the cheese gets all gooey again.  Right?  This pizza cheese was still hard as though it had been in the fridge overnight.  I asked them if they could put it in the oven longer to melt the cheese and it still didn't do the trick.  Okay...not that big of a deal.  But gross.

THE SECOND TIME, however....it was late.  I had been drinking.  All I wanted was pizza.  I would have eaten anything.  I ordered some type of margarita sicilian square.  Well...I'm eating it in the cab and I'm noticing it's almost impossible to hold with one hand.  A small square of pizza!  Every time I pick it up it takes the most flaccid shape imaginable.  So I'm eating and thinking about how soft and gooey it is...""hmm...I guess it's just really cheesy.""

OH NO.  Finally my drunk ass realizes that it's not gooey cheese.  It's RAW DOUGH.  I am eating raw dough.  The very bottom of the dough was cooked but everything hiding under the cheese was just icky sticky floury raw dough.  Vom.

The chicken here may not be as high-quality as that of it's more centrally located enemy, but the plethora of ways it can be prepared at Cluck U more than makes up for it. Now if only this place wasn't so far north, or maybe if it wasn't so incompetently operated, then maybe it would deserve more than 3 stars.

My favorite item on the menu here has to be the ""Sloppy Sandwich"", which is Cluck U's best attempt at aping the deep-fried munchie overload sandwiches that are offered late night at PJ's Grill on Frambes. I always go for the buffalo version, which comes with buffalo chicken, french fries, and coleslaw all piled high on a kaiser sub bun. If you don't eat it directly out of the wrapping foil that it comes in, you're likely to ruin whatever you're wearing with a sloppy white mess that's sure to be the cause for embarrassment later in the evening. 

The chicken wings aren't bar either. They're consistently meaty and soaked in whichever sauce you order on them, and go excellent with a side of ranch dressing. Last I remember, you get charged extra for any sort of condiments or dipping sauces you may add on to your order, which is kind of annoying at times.

Ordering on the phone here is always an adventure, as the store is usually run by just one person that clearly doesn't want to be there at the time. They've only messed my order up once, which is surprising given the apathetic tone that the person on the other end of the line conveys when asking you if you're interested in adding a side of ranch on to your order.

Dig it:  butternut squash sauce, chestnuts (?!:)), and broccoli, with some wallflower cheese (didn't notice it) and dank bread = delicious.  This was pizza with soul.

To make matters better, I had a Blackberry sodee that Hot Lips makes themselves.  No corn magic here, just pure can sugar and blackberry pulp at the end, on account'a I forgot to shake the bottle.  And the finale:  a chewy, flaky, and overwhelmingly delicious chocolate chip cookie, although I maintain I could have chosen the chocolate cookie and been just as pleased.

I learned two things that day (today):  Hot Lips has the dank pizza, a lesson that's worth repeating, and apparently you can stick an otherwise homely butternut squash through a food processor and, miraculously, out comes a beauty queen pizza sauce.

expensive. too much over rated; if you're not  Filipino you'll think the food is authentic; it is not
the price is between a tiny bowl for $5.50 and then a medium size bowl still tiny for $9.50
too oily and filled with sauce; 
most meat are tough and hard to chew
dirty premises; the outside is clean but the washroom is mostly unavailable
people serving don't wear gloves and I caught the woman with long hair who wiped her nose
where they get their meat, it is unknown
not much vegetables just all saucy and soupy food
bread/ pastries they sell are laid out in the counter only
no serviettes on the table
drinks, expensive
servers all smiles that's all they have to offer nothing else

In this day and age, this restaurant wants to get rich quick and it isn't worth it. For those Filipinos who are used to paying too much, stop.

While eatting, one of the workers struck up a conversation with me who stated that the American hot dog is a dieing food and I though humm kind of yeah.

Other things I Iiked about this place is the inside seating you can stare outside to the people walking by and the outside seating is nice.

The restaurant is cool and small inside. It was crush time at lunch the other day with the line almost out the door and almost all seating taken.

Placed my order for a Chicago Dog ($3.25), a small fry ($1.60), and a large drink ($1.90). With taxes it came to $7.31. Not a cheap lunch.

The dog did not snap when I bit into it which is what I used to have happen when ordering dogs in Chicago. Perhaps due to the lunch rush the dogs were not cooking as long as is necessary.

Also, I have never seen a Chicago dog with kraut before. I had to have them minus this off because I don't think this is how they serve them in Chicago.

Fries were okay if not greasy. I've had better homemade fries. And yes, I ate in, so the fries were hot when I ate them.

The bun was almost oversteamed - it almost fell apart on me.

There really needs to be a bigger dining room here. Yeah I know on the nice days you can go to the park but when it is hovering around 30 no one was sitting in the park.

If you add in the parking ($1.25 for an hour @ the city lot next door) its almost $8.56 which is pricy for one small dog, a small fry and a large drink.

This place will suffice if I am close by and get the craving. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't 100% authentic. It takes more than Vienna posters for that.

Guess I will be heading back downtown to Denver to see what's down that way.

Overall it was a solid 3. If they worked on making the dogs have a bit more bite to them, cleaned up the fries a bit, and watched how the buns were steamed then I'd give them a 4.",2010-01-02 03:11:56

NINJA CHICKEN NUGGETS - $5.99
Just needed a quick bite and this was the cheapest menu item - it was a lot of food! The chicken nuggets were very juicy and flavorful - no sauce needed b/c they are already marinated. The nuggets are dark meat ... and there were 3 shrimp chips which was a nice surprise :) 

Restaurant space is small inside. Next time i'd like to try the Ninja Crispy Chicken and Fried Giant Squid. A fun place to eat with a group of people so you can try other dishes. Reading Jang C's review, looks like they are the same owner as Kung Fu Tea.

My friend and I shared a giant squid combo and a ninja crispy chicken. We got the curry rice with the combo and as someone who doesn't really like Japanese style curry, it was really good. It had a very deep onion flavor and it was so good to me. The fried squid was decent and it comes with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. The side vegetables are mediocre and the miso soup was watery. 

The ninja chicken chop was pretty huge. Opening the paper holder for it was kinda confusing but it was cute. Juicy chicken but I think we waited a bit too long to eat it cause it wasn't super crispy.

I placed an order through the Subway app, with a pickup time of 9:30 PM, and the app charged my bank account and told me my order was ready. I arrived there at 9:38 PM. When I arrived, both doors were locked, and the one person inside (who later claimed to be the manager) turned the Open sign off as soon as I walked up. I knocked on the door, and tried to tell her that I had already paid and I just wanted to pick up my food, but she would not come to the door to talk to me and insisted on yelling things I could barely hear.

So, I called the restaurant, and the woman inside answered and told me that she'd already spoken to Postmates and that I wouldn't be charged. I told her that it wasn't through Postmates, it was through the Subway app, and I HAD been charged. She insisted she hadn't gotten any online orders, and asked me what I'd ordered. When I told her it was a turkey salad, she immediately said, ""Oh, I did put together a salad."" Um...so you DID put together an online order, you didn't bother to look at the pickup time, you thought nothing of it when nobody came to pick it up, AND you didn't think that maybe the person knocking at your door was there to pick up the salad you'd put together?

She did give me my food at that point, and tried to tell me that they close at 9:30 PM in the winter, literally while standing in front of a door that listed their closing time as 10 PM. She also told me ""You're the third person that's knocked on the door tonight saying they'd already ordered."" Uh, yeah, because that's what happens when you close thirty minutes early and your app is still taking orders! I don't for a second believe they were actually supposed to close at 9:30 PM, as it's listed at 10 PM everywhere from their website to their app to the actual door to here on Yelp, and I've been there many times before and they've never once closed at 9:30 in the past, including in the winter.

Not at Wendy's! Yep, they just let it all free flow onto your burgers and fries. I sure as heck don't want ketchup when I could have a side of black hair and half my order missing. What a treat!

The drive thru is average. When I recently went, only one of the drive thru lanes was operating. If you are only taking orders from one lane, what is the point of offering two?

I took away a star because while taking my order the girl helping me repeated my order several times getting it wrong. I only ordered 2 meals so I was unsure why it was such an issue. They were fairly simple orders, I got hubs the bigger plate with noodles, orange chicken, and a double order of Beijing beef. I ordered a plate with double Beijing beef and fried rice. I adore the Beijing beef, it's the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. The bell peppers and onions that come with it were crunchy and fresh and lovely. Their meat is better than most traditional Chinese joints I've been to. I like that this location has a drive thru. And it's right next to a Target which is always a plus lol.",2019-03-04 01:09:16

I doubt the legitimacy of the other reviews here.

When they first arrived, I ordered a steak and cheese combo sub and it was incredible.  It was gooey and the steak was actually seasoned and it has these great overall chewiness to it.  I also had a pizza and it was fine.

Then slowly, over a number of different orders, the quality has just dropped through the floor, then through the floor and through the center of the earth and back through the other side.  Then it crashed through the floor in my bizarro house in the Andomeda galaxy.

I've had buffalo wings with the consistency of a bone wrapped in a dirty sponge.  I have had a dry cheese burger that was missing the cheese I ordered. I have had a pastrami sub that was like a salted rag on a bun.  But the last straws came recently: the ""famous"" broccoli fettuccine alfredo.  What an affront to humanity.  The sauce was like dishwater and the pasta was dry and hard at the ends.   The best part of it was the broccoli, and that is a serious problem if the vegetables are the best things to come from a dive delivery joint.  Then came the time I got a pizza with mushooms.  It was like someone threw a water balloon into its box, kicked it in the face, and carried it like a suitcase to my house.  It was all effed up.  All the cheese had slid onto one slice, there was weird tomato and mushroom water everywhere, and it stank.  That's right: my pizza was smelly.  Like a plastic bottle left in the car or the inside of an old thermos.  The final time I ordered a steak and cheese hoping it would be a return to past glories-no.  It was just ok.  The magic was gone.

In conclusion, do not believe the other reviews.  I don't care how close by you live.",2014-07-18 15:17:17

Result? Filled tummies!! The batter was never too thick, just the right crispiness. The curry is the Japanese curry-a bit on the sweeter side, and a good serving of rice to soak up every little drop of the sauce.

I think they are owned by the same people as the Kung Fu Tea franchise. So they already have a good pedigree for some good eats. And just like Kung Fu Tea, they already have a ton of locations spread across the East coast. Now they've finally made it to Atlanta. 

This place is tiny. You can't bring a big group here. I think it's more of a takeout place. You can dine in, but there are like 6-7 tables you can choose from. It's doable, but if it's busy, you might not find seating. 

They serve a bunch of deep-fried crap such as chicken, squid, beef, shrimp, and more chicken. They do love fried chicken. They offer Samurai Crispy Chicken, Ninja Crispy Chicken, Fried Chicken Wings, Chicken Nuggets,  and Exploding Chicken Cutlets. 

So what's the difference between Samurai and Ninja? Well, the samurai one is sliced and diced, like what a samurai would do. The Ninja one is this gigantic, 12 oz, fried chicken breast. 

The Ninja Crispy Chicken comes in this cardboard box. You have to cut and open the box in a complicated, weird way to get to the hot, crispy chicken inside. It comes with a spicy mayo sauce. But you can ask for other sauces. The meat is super-juicy, and the crust is nice and crispy. The seasoning on the chicken was on point. It was a dang good fried chicken. 

I also tried their Fried Giant Squid. It was a whole squid, fried and seasoned like the chicken. It came in a box to eat out of since they chopped it up into pieces. It was a lot easier to eat than the chicken. It was also delicious. They have crispy wafers at the bottom to catch all the oil, and you can eat them as well.

I ordered a side of Minced Meat and rice. It's like Lu Rou Fan. It's actually Rou Zao Fan. It's made from pork as well. It was nice and flavorful. I liked it. 

The thing about the ""Deep Fried"" part of the menu is that's all you get: the fried meat. You get no sides, no nothing. For a complete meal, I suggest getting the combos. The combos seem to come on a plate with a rice of your choice (minced meat rice, curry, or white). Or if you're too American, you can get Fries instead of the rice. It comes with some veggies as well. 

I think the ""Deep Fried"" stuff is like street food. You get it in a box, and you wander around that strip mall eating the fried meat. I suggest the combo since you don't have to deal with that weird box contraption for your ninja crispy chicken.

One thing I wished they had were beer and pickled vegetables. After eating mounds of fried meat, I needed some type of acidity to balance it.

He asked a different person to clean the table and in the mean time I went to the restroom. When I came out of the restroom an employee was just walking out to start cleaning. 

When we were getting ready to leave my father got up to refill his drink. As he turned to walk back to the table he slipped and fell on a large wet spot on the floor.

FOOD 4/5

I tried the following: 
Ninja Crispy Chicken XL 5/5
Extremely good!! I hate to admit I truly enjoy it. It was so tender and absolutely delicious!! Maybe it was so cold at night and I took a detour to Tea Top, the Crispy Chicken was not as crispy as I wanted it to be when I got home.

Fried Diced Beef - 3/5
It was just a-ok for me. I don't know, maybe this was my first time to have fried beef? 

Minced Meat Rice - 4/4
It was good. The minced meat part was delicious! Just not so sure about the rice.

Verdict so far? Highly recommend the Ninja Crispy Chicken!!! A must order!! ;)


AMBIENCE 3/5

There is really not much ambience. It was not bad, just a small basic store with like 4 standard tables and 1 tall one. This is probably a take out food outlet. Place is new and looked clean to me. 


SERVICE 5/5

Staff was polite and took the initiative to check with the kitchen about food allergy. Staff mentioned currently there is a one-for-one promotion for the Ninja Crispy Chicken. 

Will definitely return and I want to try the fried Shrimps too!! :D

When I wanted to eat ""healthier"" for the approaching new year, there comes a yummilicious fried chicken place. It's just not fair ;(

I told them about it after meeting up a friend for lunch at Snackboxe Bistro. She's Chinese and lives in NYC and came to visit. ChiChop is a Taiwanese franchise and is very popular and well liked, especially in NYC. It's located in the HMart plaza in Doraville and on the same side as Snackboxe Bistro. My friend noticed it after we met up for lunch and told me about it. I was excited to try. I'm all about new experiences.

So I went with a group of friends so we could check out ChiChop. We already knew that the space is small. It's more of a take out place. They have very limited amount of space to sit. We purposely met up at 11 am, when it opened so we could claim some seats.

The menu is straight forward and offer a lot of bento like dishes. You order up front and they will let come give your food when it's done. All the dishes come out in carryout style. It's fast food type.

I ordered the fried diced beef for my hubby. For myself, I ordered king oyster mushroom, french fries, and passion fruit calpis soda. 

After 15-20 mins, my order came out. The fried diced beef looked like a dessert cause of the purplish black color. The french fries were crispy and good. Perfect. The king oyster mushroom had a nice crunch and when biting into it, it looked and tasted a bit like a scallop. The pieces were large and the first few bites were good. After that, it was too chewy and I wasn't a fan of it. The passion fruit calpis soda was too sweet. I had to let it dilute a bit, afterwards it did taste good.

Overall, I am glad I tried it but I wouldn't care to come back.

There are huge menu signs throughout the restaurant and you can choose from pre-made refrigerated sushi and various rice bowls combos.  I think this place is has some kind of deal with Coca-Cola as they seem to push Coke on every combo.

I went with the main feature du jour - the (lame-sounding) Olympic curry - which has a sizable pork cutlet over shredded chicken curry on rice for $9 after taxes.  The rice was a little dry and the curry was pretty average, even with the shredded chicken - however, the tonkatsu (pork cutlet) was awesome - juicy, flaky and so fresh.  Overall, the tonkatsu saved the curry dish alone.

I am unfamiliar with this part of Ohio, and noticed the signs on the side of the highway denoting fast food was coming up.  I was driving to a function in Newark and needed some food.  

The first issue is finding the place.  Due to the aesthetics of the area, it's hard to determine where the Wendy's even is.  All the buildings are red brick and have some pretty small signage, at least while driving and you're unfamiliar with the area.  The next issue is actually getting to the Wendy's.  You have to go to the end of the road and maneuver a roundabout before trying to get into the parking lot.  

Once the trek to find the Wendy's has taken place, the long wait ensures.  Is there some mid-Saturday morning rush I'm unaware of?  It wasn't lunch time, it wasn't during the week when you'd assume local workers would be trying to grab a quick lunch.

Take note that Taiwanese fried chicken is known for its grease and tenderness (the perfect contrast between crispy & moist) - so don't be expecting super clean-cut & dry fried chicken.",2018-12-28 01:48:49

My first time coming in for breakfast I just got an egg and cheese muffin like sandwich with nothing but salt/pepper, and it was really bland.  I tried the black forest flat bread sandwich today, 20 minutes ago, and it was really good!

This sandwich comes with four slices of ham, an egg the size of the actual flat bread and your choice of cheese.  It's all microwaved so not crispy like I thought it may be from the commercial spot I saw.

I put onion, bell pepper, jalapeno, tomato and pepper jack cheese along with salt/pepper, and it's a nice change from typical breakfast fare.  I will say, don't just tear right into the sandwich.  Let it sit for about 10 minutes so all the veggies warm up along with it.  So good!

Okay. What I expect from Taco Bell/KFC:
1. Going to be pretty dirty.
2. Not going to have what I want.
3. Going to order whatever new combination of bread-wrapper/meat/cheese/sauce combination that Taco Bell comes up with.
4. Going to run into some freaks
5. Going to feel greasy after I eat it.

This isn't the *best* Taco Bell--I can't imagine what that would be like. This location is conveniently located across the street from a certain friend of mine making it easy to get late night foodstuffs [accent on the ""stuffs""], go back to said friend's house and peek out the window and wait for the lights to go off at night. I wish I lived across the street from Taco Bell/KFC.

What I've found about this particular Taco Bell/KFC is that it mostly caters to the undesirables of the world. It's usually families with their screaming kids or freaks that go here.

I went the other night and stepped over a few errant straw wrappers and assorted debris [1]. I wanted a Steak Quesadilla but they didn't have steak [2]. The guy behind the register suggested the Triple Steak Burrito and said that they had the steak for that. Curious. They have TRIPLE STEAK but not singular steak. I order the Triple Steak Burrito [3]. While my BF and I wait for our food, some creepy guy scarfing his KFC Bowl [which are decent if not a little salty] glances over at me [4]. I make eye contact. He doesn't break eye contact! I do my patented look-over-my-shoulder-and-then-make-eye-contact-again-and-point-at-myself-while-mouthing-""me""? move. He keeps staring. I say ""Hello. Nice night tonight."" Nothing. Still staring. I turn to face the window. My BF thinks I'm crazy. I start yelling, ""This guy is STARING at me!"" Still staring. I hear this guttural sound. It's his voice! He speaks in one of the lowest and deepest voices I have ever heard: ""You gonna get some tonight?"" ""You gonna get some tonight?"" ""You gonna get some tonight?"" he repeats over and over again.

Finally our food comes after probably 5 minutes. We go over to the aforementioned friend's house and look out their window. He's still STARING at us! Oh well. It's not my apartment and now I'm glad I don't live across the street from the Taco Bell.

I eat this monstrosity. It's strangely good. Also very salty. I feel great after the first few bites. Once I get down to the last few bites, I feel depressed and a little greasy [5].

When I ordered from Grubhub they would always get to my house before the estimated time of delivery usually 10 minutes before. The food was hot, it was good, they did everything correctly and made sure to call in case something was missing or they had a question about my order, it was literally my go to restaurant for getting food, especially their chicken fingers dinner both buffalo and regular. If i had a special request they would make it happen. Delivery guy that used to work there who had a mohawk was such a cool guy! he was always friendly and courteous, tipped him extra at times because he was always great at what he did. but as the years went by, things got slippery and the quality slowly declined. When i would ask for ranch in the cups and not the stupid packets, they would give me the packets anyway. The taste difference between the packets and the cups is very obvious, the packets taste like cheap imitation 7/11 ranch meanwhile the cups of ranch which are most likely poured from a jug that are from vendors that specialize in sauces, tastes like REAL buttermilk ranch. Such a small thing that i constantly ask for but yet the person that handles my order doesn't seem to care much to read the special request that I wrote for them to do, i specifically say a CUP of ranch and not the packet please. I even tip these guys extra usually, sometimes either 5 or 10 bucks just because I understand it can be a hard job and getting things like this done can be tough when you're out and about all day long delivering. they also get to my house very very late at times, one time they got to my house an hour later than suggested and all i asked for was a chicken finger dinner. I asked the delivery guy what happened and he asked me what I meant, i asked him did something happen or if it was busy, and he said no it wasn't, and i told him that the food was an hour late. He apologized but things like that can't keep happening so often. The quality of the food itself just fluctuates as well, sometimes tasting like its been sitting around getting soggy for a while, or sometimes being hot and freshly made. This place is in a serious need of a revamp I'd say, they need to understand quality control, READING THE SPECIAL REQUESTS OR CALLING THE CUSTOMER TO ASK FOR QUESTIONS, Timeliness, and just having a genuine interest and care for making food. I know it can be very tough, I've worked in the food business for almost 3 years, but if you cannot understand these things then customers will notice and they will not have any interest in trying to come here anymore. a restaurant should be like both a business and a family, take care of each other, meanwhile checking for ways to improve in areas that are slacking even if that means criticizing constructively, and hold yourselves accountable and take the job and food you're preparing seriously. I want to like the restaurant, but it has just become more of a last resort for me if im hungry more than a place that I feel excited to order from now. I Don't think I'll be ordering from here anymore.

TL;DR Food used to be great but slowly declined. They don't seem to take the restaurant as seriously as they used to and the service is almost passionless. They have a lot of work to do in many areas if they want the restaurant to be put on the spot as one of the greats, otherwise don't have the restaurant open at all if you can't take yourselves seriously. If you slip up too much, it becomes obvious and customers will notice.",2017-01-09 18:27:41

I got in line at the drive thru around 10:30pm on this Thursday night. There were probably six cars in front of me. I waited about 15 minutes before I got up to the speaker to order & was immediately asked to wait & told that she'd be with me soon. At this point there was easily another four cars behind me, maybe more. I understand when you're slammed or understaffed & scrambling to catch up so I was super patient. A solid five minutes passed, at least, & more & more cars were lining up & I was starting to think they'd forgotten about me so I said, hello? Nothing. A couple of minutes later I got an apology for the long wait & she asked for my order. I ordered cheese fries & a shake. Afterwards I waited about another 10 or 15 minutes before I got up to the window & when I did, it was wide open & no people in sight. The car in front of me was parked on the side of the building presumably still waiting for their food. A couple of minutes after that, the girl came to the window & acknowledged me & then came back with my shake. I took it & handed her my debit card. I waited a few more minutes until she handed me a bag of food & I took it & drove home which takes about 10 minutes. When I left, the car in front of me was still sitting there waiting. So I get home & park & then suddenly realize that my debit card was never returned. I was super frustrated; it was definitely my responsibility to make sure I had it before I left, but I just waited so long between each interaction that it just threw me off & disoriented me. I called my husband to ride back to the restaurant with me & decided to eat some cheese fries while I waited for him to come out. I opened the bag & there was a hot dog inside. Really? Ok. Good thing I'm already going back, whatever, I'll get my cheese fries then. I get back there about 10 minutes later & there was a car, maybe the same one, I can't remember, parked next to the building, waiting (still?). The drive thru line was still crazy long so I went inside to the counter. I took the hot dog in with me just to be a decent person & show them that I did indeed get the wrong food but mostly expecting them to let me keep it. To their credit, I was immediately acknowledged by the cook when he noticed I came in with a bag of food & I started telling him that I got the wrong food & didn't get my card back. I was super calm & nice & I did not even complain. I was being unreasonably cool, honestly. He interrupted me to say that ""she"" had already told him, & then he said, ""It's her fault, to be honest. It's her fault, she's not doing a good job."" He was so aggravated, which I get, but he didn't apologize to me & then he took the hot dog, which was still hot, & threw it away right in front of me! I was like, what! Ok then. I waited a couple of minutes & then a woman (not the one who helped me at the drive thru) walked over with my food while loudly complaining to no one in particular, ""When are people going to learn that Steak n Shake is not fast food? If you want it fast, go to Taco Bell. If you want it fresh, come here."" I just kind of smiled in disbelief that this was how they were choosing to handle this, especially considering I DID NOT COMPLAIN ONE BIT SO WHY ARE YOU SO DEFENSIVE. As I was walking out, the woman turned to the cook & said, ""You know what the problem is, we shouldn't have a drive thru."" Um ok. I've never had this problem at the Sawmill location so maybe it's youguys & not the menu but whatever.

You can mess up left & right but if you're nice to me & you make it right, I will be cool & give you another chance. What pissed me off was the way the two other employees handled it. It was so unprofessional & inappropriate to speak that way to me & in front of me. I don't care who's to blame. At least she was nice to me.

The minced meat rice is delicious and even more flavorful than the curry rice somehow. Don't get fries. They are nothing special. I'm a fan of this place because they are focused.

Thanks for the shoutout Grace M/W (lol) as this place really is just another piece of Taiwan in Atlanta that has been missing from the growing ATL foodie scene!

ChiChop is a small shop with limited seating. We got here at 1:30pm on a Sunday and it wasn't so bad. Food took a while after we ordered but we tried to be patient, as hungry as we were. The way the menu was organized was a little confusing but the guy at the register got me what I wanted - the HUGE chicken patty!! It's called the Ninja Crispy Chicken (B1) on the menu. It doesn't come with the braised pork over rice (lu rou fan ËÇâÁá•È£Ø) that I call comfort food, but I ordered a side of it. It's a big portion for such a good price. Many Taiwanese restaurants in Atlanta charge so much for a bowl of braised pork over rice but the value here is half the price. 

I can't speak for the other dishes on the menu - they just looked ok to me. But the Ninja Crispy Chicken and a side order of braised pork over rice is worth every penny. The fried chicken patty was hot and perfectly fried. I love how there are no bones - sometimes in Taiwan, I've found bones in my fried chicken patty, which can be a pain to eat when eating while walking.

While most people seem to be saying that they are not happy with SMAK because of the cost, I'd be happy to pay 13$ for a salad if I knew it was safe for me to eat.

I just found out a second ago though, that that is not the case.  I ate a salad on Thursday and I felt sick afterwards. So bad that while I bought the same salad on Friday, I couldn't bring myself to eat it. Suffered all weekend on and off. I'm lucky it wasn't worse.

I had figured it couldn't have been smak because they are 100% gluten free. Gut feeling though was telling me something different .

I called them today and just asked about a few of their ingredients because I was saving the salad to eat after a busy monday. They let me know their nuts and lentils on the salad are from Dan-D pak!

Cheap, yes... but the last time I wrote Dan-d pak they took very few measures to avoid cross contamination. So if you are a sensitive celiac, beware. I wonder if the reviewer below me who spent the afternoon in the bathroom was having an allergic reaction.

I think what they don't understand is that cross contamination can cause extraordinary pain for allergic people, as well as devastating health effects.

Unfortunately, I'm guessing their choice to use Dan-D-Pak is because it is cheaper than items that are guaranteed free of cross contamination. So in a round about way I am complaining about what everyone else it's complaining about : for SMAK, it's all about the money. I guess I have an extra problem with the fact that they are willing to do it at the expense of people's health and well-being.

The two stars is that they are nice enough, and I may stop by as they sell muffins from Lemonade which are actually gluten free!

I think I was lucky. I've had much worse experiences with cross contamination before.

Why I feel I have to put myself through this is an exercise between my id and a suitable psychological diagnostician, but I digress.

A little over two years ago my family and I stopped in to JItB (another location entirely) as we were new to the area and never eaten at one before- the food was of institutional quality and the place didn't look to have had a solid cleaning in months. I won't be much further on that one as it's been a while and things might've changed drastically since then... but it left an impression.

As fate would have it, today my boss and I were working nearby and we completely blew through normal lunch hours but feeling the need for some food before blood sugar issues arose and we began spouting Monty Python quotes at each other, we drove to the area and with limited time he spotted this particular establishment and chose it as our destination.

I was reticent, due to the quality of the previous experience, but a) Well, it HAD been a long time, b) we were on a pressed schedule, and c) the boss said ""go here. We went inside.

Good points: the staff was friendly enough. Good marks. The food was ""as expected."" It arrived within a reasonable period of time.

Bad marks, hence the necessity for this review at all: Is there some sort of corporate policy against cleaning for this franchise? How about building maintenance?

The floors were dirty and hadn't seen a mop in who knows how long. Spilled drinks on unoccupied tables, a men's room whose ""out off [sic] order"" sign looks to have been reposted enough times to warrant several stickers to keep the sign in place, something seemed to be growing from a suspended ceiling design element over the cashier queue; grease-adhered dust on everything in the kitchen area that wasn't within easy reach of most employees.

Here's a question: how does an ice machine suspended six feet up and higher over the drinks machine get encrusted with fingerprints? Was there an NBA team using it for high-touch contests in it's recent past? I'm not sure.

There was what seemed to be a climate control box mounting on the wall behind my table; the sad fate of the box itself is a mystery that will never be solved. The blank wire terminal connections sticking sadly out of the plate at about shoulder height post only a danger to snagged clothes as (thank God) those sort of controls are not generally high voltage.

The condition of the paint on the walls was a cry for help, and one could tell that the benches along the center wall had never been moved in recent geological time as several definable strata of dirt had accumulated behind the legs, in easy view of all. A broom hadn't been of practical use when someone's inate fears of having to move a bench during cleaning was Simply Too Much and I Can't Even for the cleaning crew.

Our typical chicken and white rice post-workout meal would have sufficed. However, we followed our craving and headed to Chick-fil-A to satisfy our arm pump that Saturday afternoon. The line was minimal and we chose to dine in. We placed our order, I swiped my credit card and we headed to our table. This is when what we had hoped to be an experience full of ""our pleasure"" turned into dissatisfaction. 

We sat down just as our food arrived. The young female employee sat down our tray without a word or gesture. She grabbed the sauce container we placed on the table, proceeded to dump the sauce packets onto our food and walk away. Bizarre? I then realized my iced coffee was missing. My boyfriend went up to ask and to also get his buffalo sauce, as he was brought the wrong packet. The same young woman grabs a sauce, forces it into his hand and walks away. At this point, it has been nearly 15 minutes and we are extremely disappointed with the lack of service. We decided to speak to the manager and I wanted to get a copy of my receipt to document the experience. The substitute manager could not find our order in the system and offered to cover our cost and remake our entire order. After a total 30 minutes, we finally had our complete order and left the restaurant. The only ""our pleasure"" came from the substitute manager after David mentioned how Chick-fil-A is setting standards in the country with ""our pleasure"". 

I do not know about you but to me, that is not the example for pleasant customer experiences. I have never had an issue at another Chick-fil-A location and hope this one can improve its local culture and customer care.",2017-06-06 01:49:50

The second time I had ... jeez, I don't even remember what it was called, that's how unremarkable it was.  It was a chicken sandwich with garlic sauce, and it was fairly wretched.  The garlic sauce tasted overly processed, the chicken was thin and dried out.  I had a side of bacon cheese fries, which were limp, greasy, and covered with FAKE bacon bits.

Me and wife was just talking about our trip last time to taiwan, of how memorable it was, of how good their foods were. And suddenly we came across this restaurant after our weekly groceries shopping at H-mart in doraville. 
This place located in the same plaza as shoya Izakaya , kura and miss gogi.

So we ordered:
1. Ninja crispy chicken.
2. Samurai crispy chicken with stew pork rice bowl.
3. Crispy shrimp with Taiwanese curry rice bowl.
4. Kiwi fruit tea drink? Forgot the name.

Both no 1 and 2 personally I think it's the same chicken, only difference is how they cut it. No 1 they serve it big slice in a special container and no 2 is bento style and they cut it into strips. Both are good, outer battered is crispy, chicken inside is tasty and juicy. The stew pork rice bowl and curry rice bowl both compliment the meal perfectly. Saltiness is about right, although a tad more salt would be too salty. 

Crispy shrimp on the other hand personally I think could tone down a little on the saltiness. But it is still taste good regardless. The drink is a perfect pair with all of these deep fried goodness meals.

Venue is clean, simple yet comfortable. Ordering style is fast food style. Seats are limited here, would not recommend for big group. There is no complain either on the service. Service is friendly, foods came out fast as well. 

Overall definitely a spot to go for a fast and tasty Taiwanese fried chicken bento meal if you are in doraville area.

I ordered the Samurai Crispy Chicken with the minced meat rice as a side. Although it sounds hefty, the portions were just the right amount. I almost wished the minced meat had a tad bit more meat but it's just about as good as I've had it in Taiwan and the way my mom makes it - it's simply comfort food.

Ordinarily, I wouldn't pay attention to packaging, but there was a lot of unnecessary packaging since we were dining in. There was a sleeve on top of the plastic that all the food was in. While it looks nice as if you bought it as a pre-packaged meal from the grocery store, it just seemed like a waste of printing and use.

There are two of these stores in the Sanford/Lake Mary area. I like this one a little better than the one at the Seminole Town Center because it's a little bigger and a little easier to get in and out of (though the parking lot itself is very cramped).

The layout here is pretty much standard issue Chipotle. It's got that faux industrial/Manhattan hipster look. Many high top communal tables down the center and a few tables around the side. What's weird is that every time I go here there's a long line of people waiting to order, but never usually that many people sitting down to eat.

I usually get a pulled pork burrito or maybe a chicken bowl. If it's really busy they have a large staff of preppers on the line to make it go quicker. Though that's kind of annoying because sometimes they get people's orders mixed up.

Food here has always been good. It tastes the same as every other Chipotle location (for better or worse). So it's consistent - not a gamble.

I've found the staff to be friendly and fairly hard-working for the most part.

The seasoning on the fried chicken here is on point, reminding me of the sTaiwanese Night Markets. I opted for A1: Ninja Crispy Chicken ($8.50) and a small Minced Meat Rice ($2), while my boyfriend got the B1: Samurai Crispy Chicken Combo ($9.99) and chose the Minced Meat Rice and a Miso Soup. 

If you want value, the combos are definitely worth it. But, the tradeoff is that you don't get the giant filet of chicken unless you order A1, which is what I wanted. I swear this chicken was almost a foot long, yet it was the most tender, juicy yet crispy piece of fried chicken I've ever had. The seasonings were so good, a mix of salty and peppery and five spice (I think?). The small cups of Minced Meat Rice/Curry Rice are also only $2 each, which is a great deal for the amount that you get. Opt for the Minced Meat Rice, which has so much flavor that you'll want more. My boyfriend and I have actually thought about ordering a few cups of those for future meals. 

The combo comes with broccoli, seaweed salad, and pickled radish. These are average, but the real star of the show is the fried chicken. They also offer fried beef, squid, shrimp, and Teriyaki options. I got my order to-go and it only took about 15 minutes. The food came out piping hot and crispy.

When someone causes you harm and you take them to court, you present your case and can claim damages from the harm done to you. I feel like this should be no different. 
A $10 meal should not have caused me all of this stress, money, time off work, and poor health!!! Completely preventable and I will never be eating at any of your restaurants again!

While waiting in my car for over half an hour the employees were gauking at me and my car. I waited for over thirty minutes in my sexy car until the engine started to die. So I finally threw in the towel and decided to go inside. When I went inside a young cruel arrogant boastful grumpy man told me that I needed to wear a face mask. Keep in mind yesterday I went to the doctors and was diagnosed with an ear infection. I told the bossy young man that I couldn't but I was holding the mask over my face. Finally I had to explain to him to give me the food or I would call corporate. He basically threw the food at me and under his breath called me a bitch. That whole entire place is corrupt. When I walked out to my 76' car I had forgotten that the battery died. I had to call triple a and had to wait another hour. When the man from triple a got here he told me the battery was fried and had to be totaled. One of the hands down worst days. I had to get out my jitterbug phone and call a taxi. The taxi finally arrived after 15 minutes. When looking out the taxi window the sassy young man who had thrown my food at me flipped me the bird.

I normally come in and do the two entree and a side plate because sometimes I can't decide on what type of chicken I want. I recently ordered the kung pao chicken and the signature orange chicken. The orange chicken is good, but any time i've gotten the kung pao chicken there is a texture about the chicken that throws me off, almost rubbery and ""fatty"" in a sense. I can't get past it and normally just stick to the orange chicken...maybe I should remember that more often.

Chick-Fil-A has only recently arrived in my native California, but as i traveled across the country to my current location in Ohio, I began to realize how prevalent they are in most populated areas of the Midwest.  

You can find me here occasionally on Saturday nights (I know, life as a grad. student is so exciting) in one of the corner booths.  I usually run over from Caribou to join the boy for dinner and then spend the rest of the evening studying there.  Most of the time, I order a six piece nugget kids' meal with fries and a lemonade, which fills me up.  This past week I had the chargrilled sandwich, and though it was very good, I was hungry again in a couple of hours, probably because I didn't have fries.  I like the chargrilled chicken better than the fried stuff, but they don't offer it in the kids' meals.  I also wish it were a little less salty, but apparently according to ""Eat This, Not That,"" it's one of the better fast food choices other than the sodium content.

The staff is usually quite nice and don't mind that I camp out in a corner booth for a few hours.  Except that one guy who keeps stealing my Skittles.",2009-11-11 00:20:51

MOD is certainly not a ma and pa store, they're a very large national chain. Regardless, I do like the build your own concept that so many other pizza places are adopting. MOD does have a good variety of choices for toppings and sauces, along with artichoke hearts which many pizza places don't offer. 

ORDERING ONLINE: 
Easy and error free via mobile phone or computer. Making your choices are as simple as checking boxes and adding a note if needed. You pay before placing the order so you'll need a credit or debit card and can write in any tip amount along with the pre selections. Received a confirmation via eMail showing all of the selections along with the tab.

THE ORDER:  
Arrived on time for the scheduled pickup and everything was ready to go, staff was pleasant. (1) 11"" inch pizza with a medium assortment of toppings, (1) Cinnamon Sugar Puff Bread - Caramel, side or ranch and a Mexi-Coke in the bottle. Pizza was hot, drink was cold and the sides were in the boxes. Easy. $8 dollars and some change for a large personal pizza is a deal in my books. 

IN SUMMARY:  
As far as the pizza goes, I'd say it was just okay but nothing stellar. Solid flavors, decent amount of toppings and cooked just right with a crispy on the outside and soft on the inside dough. This is not a thick crust or heavily loaded toppings type pizza, although they do offer a thicker crust. In similar comparison, I actually like the flavors of California Pizza Kitchen quite a bit more (although twice the price), they are very similar in style, presentation, size and texture. Where MOD seems to fall short is actually in the dough/crust, it's really not that great. It's more like a giant flour tortilla that's been baked, you can really tell if you get the side puff breads. Looks like a flour tortilla and tastes like one. The only thing they missed on my order was the fresh basil, it was on the receipt and confirmation but it was not on the pizza. The sugar puff bread was the real disappointment, they could really amp it up by deep frying it or adding a light butter glaze. Again, it just looked and tasted like a baked flour tortilla, wasn't terrible but nothing astonishing. It was also not pre-sliced as indicated by their website. Carmel dip was good and plenty sweet. Their ranch dressing is decent, it's a little smoother but less mayo-like than the usual Hidden Valley ranch. Cane sugar non-high fructose Mexi-Coke is the way to go, a little higher priced here than other places. The establishment was clean and roomy with an industrial modern styled interior. Plenty of parking with two disabled spots just right of the entrance. All in all I'd come here again, but I can't say it's the best pizza around. Certainly convenient and fairly priced.",2019-01-03 17:13:13

With that in mind, Fatburger's burgers were juicy. There was even a selection of sizes from Small Fatburger 2.5 oz to XXL Fat Burger 24 oz.

The burger stand is quint and offered limited seating and limited parking spaces for that matter. There are other locations in Downtown and even Coquitlam if you are a fan. The decor is old school and somewhat California and I was hoping for some roller-skates (yes! skates not blades).

The fries are crispy and wasn't too greasy.  $26 for two burger combos was rather steep and if I were to pay that much for a burger I might as well go to a sit down restaurant. It's simply not worth the price.",2013-03-05 03:09:42

Mustard's is well set up for COVID pickup; they place your order on an outside table and call your name. Ordering online works great, ordering in person is a little harder but they do have a window.

During this coronavirus pickup/delivery, I decided to order dinner on Postmates for pickup. I got the notice it was ready went into the Scholls Ferry location of Baja Fresh and they had no record of it. One of the cashiers called her boss on the phone and looked through the orders. Nothing there. I pulled up the receipt on my phone showing what food was ordered and where it was ordered to and that it was to be picked up. An hour later (not exaggerating) they finally made the food after I told them to cook it or give me my money back. First they told me to call Postmates, even though the order was confirmed at the right location and that there was a receipt. Yet they continued to insist to call the company and get my money back from Postmates! I have been going there for 10 years sometimes 3 times a week and they know me, so I felt quite disrespected. I was in there for one hour with no other orders and the cashiers were on the phone with the manager and coming up with one reason or another to get rid of me without the food or my money back. Finally, after the hour went by, the food was cooked (what a miracle!) The cook, who should be the manager, apologized and said he would have dealt with it differently giving me the food off of the receipt I had shown and cooked it right up and I would have been out of there in 10 min. He even recognized me as a regular customer, even though unfortunately he didn't have the authority. Also, they forgot some things in the order, which they have done quite a bit in the past with to-go orders. That is how Baja Fresh on Scholls Ferry treats their most loyal customers. I will never go back there again and feel betrayed after they have known me for 10 years, I guess that is a casualtiy of the first thing to go with people in times of cornovirus. I hear that you should be nice, especially during these hard times for these workers, but they didn't even give me the consideration or hear me out, and thought of me as a nuisance. It is going be a long cornovirus season but won't be as long if I stay out of Baja Scholls.",2020-03-27 04:20:14

We ordered a curbside pickup and paid by credit card online including providing automobile details. We called upon arrival and they did not pick up, even though it was not busy at all. We called 2 times over 10 minutes and nothing.

Called a third time and their connection was terrible but I had full bars. They hung up on us. Called again a fourth and same problem but we gave them our details and yes, they heard us. They hung up on us in the middle of the conversation but obviously heard our information because they immediately cane out to the car. They didn't try to talk to us to figure out any other details. 

We positioned the car so that the trunk was facing the door of the store - like 6 feet away. A woman comes out and dumps the food in the trunk without bothering to close it. We made it so easy for them. We have tried to tip extra during these hard times and even thought about how we could safely add to our original tip when someone recently provided amazing food delivery service.

We are just trying to get done food while remaining safe, and supporting local jobs in these hard times. We did everything we could to keep everyone safe. By not closing the trunk we had to get out on a busy street - not what we really had in mind as Covid-19 rises in Massachusetts.

This is the worst experience I've ever had at a fast food restaurant in my entire life. I know restaurants and workers are suffering. I'm literally looking for an excuse to give hard working people on the front lines a huge tip. Like recently we've been giving 35% to help people out even for quick curbside pickups.

But Qdoba - what is wrong with you? You're biting the hand that is feeding you. We literally asked you to close the trunk - it's kind of obvious. But sadly as we were asking you hung up on us. What's wrong with your phones? You had very few customers and we were literally right outside.

I came in for a sub and soup combo, and was not impressed with my meal.  The sandwich was severely lacking meat; I had a turkey sub by the way.  I could have sworn I was eating a veggie sub.  It was also very dry from either lack of condiments or a stale loaf of bread.  Now, what about the bowl of chili I had?

To start, the overall dining experience is what brought this rating from a 2 star to a 1.  The cashier took about 10 minutes to ring up my receipt.  She couldn't work the register, constantly using a separate calculator to calculate my total.  That was fine.  I paid, but didn't get my chili.  I asked for my bowl of chili, and the cashier asked for my receipt to recalculate my total. Then, she asked me to give her back all my change, she handed back my twenty dollar bill, and said I needed to pay more because she didn't ring me up for the bowl of chili.  In my head, I was think, ""Maybe you should have paid attention...."" but whatever, it's an honest mistake.  She recalculated my total so I could pay again, and she short changed me one dollar.

The problem was, she had no idea how to operate the register, so she used a separate calculator to calculate the change, and she was not paying attention.  I mentioned that she miscalculated my change, she acknowledged, apologized, and corrected my change.  Finally, the transaction had been taken care of, but where was my bowl of chili?  She asked, ""You wanted the cheese and broccoli?  No, I said I wanted chili, for the third time.  She couldn't find the bowl.  When she found it, she asked, ""Cheese and broccoli, right?"".  At this point, I said, ""Are you kidding me? I asked for chili"".  It's been 10 minutes, a line had already formed, customers were getting aggravated, and she couldn't remember what I said 5 seconds ago.

In the end, I got my bowl of chili and it was the most disappointing part of the meal.  It had no flavor, almost like it was watered down.  Sad to say, even Wendy's bowl of chili tasted better.  NEVER again to this location.",2013-02-05 21:02:39

The Salmon salad box is decent, comes with half an avocado and a decent serving of salmon. Somewhat pricey though at $13.50.

The Butterless Chicken does not taste anything like butter chicken. It has quite a strong taste of cilantro in it, which was not to my liking. It is more of a tomato/cilantro/cabbage chicken. It is healthy I guess, but left much to b e desired in the taste department for me.

The line to order and pick up were extremely long. Once we placed our order we move to the next line where there we notice the person making the hot food wasn't doing a proper job following protocol. 1: he was doing order after order after order without changing his gloves he would grab the raw bacon then the croissants, bagel, cheese , eggs everything without switching the gloves out, how are you going to touch anything else after you have touch raw meat? That is against all protocol you can get people sick. 
His station was completely filthy. Then he asked an associate to help him make more bacon while she was cutting the bacon he told her to stop and make hash browns, the person didn't change her gloves nor cleaned them. Then after 25-30 mins waiting on our food he called our number and when we looked at his hands both of his gloves were broken exposing his hands to make matters worse. We confronted him about his chooses and he said they just broke due to the heat. When you look at his hands thru the broken gloves there were completely dirty of food. Doubt that just happen at that moment.

I would go there every Saturday to have a salad bowl. I work at a restaurant as a host so I know first hand how costumers should be addressed. The costumer service the this location has consistently been TRASH. When a costumer walks in the door the people working there should smile and greet them in a friendly manner. When I walk into Qdoba the employees are rude and appear absolutely miserable as if they would rather be anywhere but their job. 

I came into Qdoba today for my usual order. The man who made my salad was fine but he did not smile at all. At the register I was rung up by the manager who was dressed in street clothing... a bright pink jacket I might add. She was extremely disrespectful. First, she over charged me 50 cents. My order always costs $7.50 and she charged me $8.00. I am not a person who likes to cause unnecessary trouble and I usually let these things go as I did in this situation. The manager didn't make eye contact the entire time during the transaction and could care less about presenting herself in a professional way... THE MANAGER. SERIOUSLY??  Brushing it off I sat at a table to have a food. About 5 bits in I look at my bowl to see a lady bug crawling across my food. Im reasonable... I understand that lady bugs can fly and that this wasn't the fault of the establishment necessarily. Bugs unwanted and inevitably come in with produce sometimes. Regardless of the circumstance in which the bug got into my food, I was completely grossed out by it. I took the bowl up to the counter and was first addressed by the man who made the bowl. The manager was standing at the register chatting with a man who was clearly her friend and not a costumer ordering. She was more interested in speaking with him than actually addressing a costumer that was clearly upset. The man saw the bug as I pointed it out and proceeded to throw the bowl away and say ""she'll help you in a minute,"" as he walked away. When the women finally acknowledged me, I demanded my money back. Again she would not give me eye contact or the time of day to apologize for the experience I had just had. The appropriate response would have been saying in a GENUINE fashion ""I am sorry that that happened. Can I offer you a new order on us?"" The women refunded my money and said nothing more than ""okay it's finished"" in the most disinterested negative way. 

I am appalled by the way this situation was handled and by the way this women spoke to and treated me. I will NEVER be eating at a Qdoba again. It is embarrassing to have such shit employees and such a terrible manager in charge. Of course the employees aren't going to care about doing a good job if the person managing them is so incompetent that they are unable to demonstrate proper costumer service. Absolutely disguising. I am more disgusted with the manager then the damn bug in my food. I wish I caught her name because I would do my best to report her.",2017-12-31 07:11:42

The pizza itself is average, with a crispy, thin crust and inventive toppings such as pear. On slow days, however, the slices appear limp and glazed over, reheated until piping hot. The aforementioned pear slice lacked seasoning and upset my stomach for the next two days.

I can't even begin to describe the disappointment from this store. But I'll try. Every year, our company participates in the big corporate 5k out in Lake Eola and cater our dinner. Last year was the first year we used Firehouse (though a different location) and had a pleasant experience. I had called this location last year but I got to them too late as they were already booked up on catering orders for the race. So this year, I got to them early in order to be able to use this location. Placing the catering order was easy enough and the manager who took my order was helpful and pleasant. We requested a 5PM pick up for the day of. I'm naturally a worry wart, so I showed up at the restaurant at 4:30PM to be there as soon as the food was ready. When I walked in a told them who I was the girl behind the counter said to another worker ""I guess we need to start their order first."" I asked how long that would take since it was ordered for 5PM and she said between 30-40 minutes. The entire time they were working on the order, there was a man behind the counter yelling about how busy they were and how they had no time for any orders and how overwhelmed they were. I later found out this man was the manager. At 5:20, they were still working on our order and let us know it would be another 10-15 minutes. I asked to cash out so I could be ready to go as soon as they were done and they passed me off through 3 different people because ""I don't have time to ring this in - didn't you ring it in."" I was beyond angry at this point and just wanted to get the heck out of there. We finally did, showed up late to our event but had our food. Dinner rolls around and we were surprised to find that MOST of the sandwiches were not labeled. Some of them had a pickle, some of them didn't. The lettuce was brown and soggy and the sandwiches were falling apart, obviously rushed when being prepared. At no time did the manager apologize for the service or the delay.

Once again, that was not the problem. When I get to the window to get my order, the manager, a large lady, just had an attitude. She didn't have the right order for me, and I could tell that she was just flustered and frustrated with everything and everybody...and that seemed to rub off on a few of the employees that I saw. While I was at the window, she walked off to grab something, and I could see her eating some hot Cheetos out of its bag as she returned back to the food area. The crazy thing is she's sweating profusely, sticking these chips in her mouth with her hands, and coming back and handling everyone's food with her bare hands without having washed them or putting gloves on. And her attitude was just the worst when having to talk to her. I, eventually, had to pull up to wait for my order to be brought to my car. And the employee that brought it out had about the same type of attitude (if not worse) than that of her manager. I left feeling worse, knowing that I stayed in line for over 20 minutes, just to get this kind of crappy and rude behavior and service.

Price is solid for the amount of food you get. I normally get the Fried Chicken, with Mince Meat/Rice and a Miso Soup combo. You have different choices for the combo and etc but I'm pretty simple.

You would think that if your restaurant is a ""Grand Opening"", the employees would be more friendlier.  That was not the case here.  The guy that opened up the restaurant not once spoke a word to greet his customers, smiled, nor even bothered to acknowledge us, his first guests.  We let it go because we didn't want to have a bad vibe, claimed our seats (because this restaurant is really small), and went up to the register to order.  There were many things that I had wanted to try, especially the fried squid.  Said man still did not speak to us until I said hello first (like seriously?) and gave my order.  Fried squid was really disappointing.  Not crispy nor flavorable at all.  Batter was actually on the soggy side.  The dip only helped so much.  Tasted my cousin's fried king oysters and it was also bland and chewy.  The teriyaki chicken was the only thing that seemed reasonable to me because it was flavorable and tender.  

Now, here's the kicker...my friend's chicken strip had a thin metal cord sticking from it.  It wasn't like it was thrown into the batter, but more like literally sticking out of the chicken itself.  She took it to the staff and they exchanged her meal for her.

TL;DR: Tempura bits make everything better.

Came here on Christmas Eve when one of the sushi places I was trying to go to wasn't open. Props to them for being open on a holiday!

I ordered the Ebiten bowl, which came with chicken teriyaki, big pieces of ebi tempura, and rice. The chicken teriyaki is super flavourful, and it mixes super well with the rice. The ebi tempura tastes like it's fried with clean oil (yay!), but gets soft pretty fast.

While the proteins were great, the thing that made the meal super satisfying was the tempura bits they served on the side. Throughout the meal, I found myself constantly mixing fresh tempura bits into the rice, along with the leftover chicken teriyaki sauce and mayo. Since the bits were so crunchy, I didn't really mind that the tempura was a little soft. I could see these making a plain onigiri or curry bowl at least 100% better.

Overall a very good, nostalgic experience for me, since I used to eat there almost every week during an internship. It's nice to see that their quality has stayed consistent over the years!",2020-07-25 19:48:10

You have got to try the minced meat rice bc it's amazing. Get the combo meal as you get this amazing minced meat along with either a drink or miso soup. 

I had the samurai crispy chicken combo. The combo comes with a standard miniature seaweed salad, yellow radishes, broccoli chunks, and carrot slices. The chicken was delicious. Yes, it was a true definition of crispy. I think the only con is that there's not more of the chicken portion.

The hubs had the grilled squid. This seemed to be his fav thus far. His curry rice was okay, nothing extraordinary. Get the minced meat version. Sooo much tastier. 

I also had the fried diced beef the hubs to-go for me awhile back, and that was good. The french fries were average, nothing special about them. I might try the hibachi style the next time around as it looks interesting...

Parking is pretty plentiful as ChiChop is in the H Mart complex. It's on the right hand side where the stairs are.

I have never been inside this location, but I was a frequent drive thru customer. The drive thru service has been good and the food is always good. But when I came inside to eat today, I saw a side of their service that I've never seen before. 

First off, not one employee smiled at me during any of my interactions. With that, as I sit here and watch the staff help other customers now, they are still not smiling. The looks on all of their faces are blank and unfriendly. Of course, as soon as the customer walks away, these employees turn around and chat and laugh amongst each other. Um, ok. Also, when they say, ""my pleasure"" they aren't even attempting to fake it. You can tell that they don't even want to say it. 

Second, when the young lady brought my food out and was calling for ""whoever ordered Number 1 with bottled water,"" I rushed over to her because she was only looking in one direction, and when she handed the tray to me, the water bottle was rolling around on it and knocked into my fries and I lost some on the floor. I nearly dropped the tray, but she just walked away with out a care. (Please stand the water upright.) 

I mean seriously, I'd say there must be something in the water they're drinking, but that's not right because they seem to be reacting just fine with each other. 

The only employee that seems nice, is the older woman who is walking around cleaning up the tables and stocking things. She's been smiling to children, so that's good to see.

Oh and don't let me get started on the ""fries"" if you even want to call them that. They were more similar to shards than actual food. I am positive they were re-fried once if not twice!!! I guess this location just assumes that since they are operating after-hours all of their customers will be too intoxicated to know the difference...WRONG! Complete waste of money, time and calories, so I just threw the whole meal away! God is really trying to tell me to give up on fast food, and this experience is definitely helping me move towards that goal. I wish I could give this place a big fat pulsating ZERO!!!",2019-03-08 06:20:26

More so, this is a review of this specific location. I work a 5 minute walk away from here so often find myself eating here for lunch. The food quality is always good and I have never had any issues. This particular location has an employee that walks around and grabs refills for you which is convenient if it's not too busy. 

The reason for 4 stars is the huge lines that this location sees during peak hours (mostly from Chase which is next door). If you show up between 11:30-12:30 on a workday you will be waiting in line for 20 minutes. The drivethru also has a tendency to double (!!) wrap around. As a result, I suggest parking next door at Graeters or across the street as it can be difficult to back out when the drivethru is double wrapped around the building.",2018-02-26 17:13:58

For these prices I would expect some chips at a minimum. 

They make their own ice cream. Again- pricey. $4.25 for a single scoop. They at least will give you 2 half scoops in your small.

I'm happy to say that with the old owners returning and the other guy that ran the spot quitting, this place has been better than ever. The food is always hot, delicious and served with a smile as expected of any good establishment. My favorite menu item being the buffalo chicken dinner is always cooked extremely well, served with HUGE portions of chicken, and their steak fries being a personal favorite, have usually been cooked nice and crispy on the outside, yet soft and tender on the inside. The chicken is nicely seasoned, yet well smothered in that tangy buffalo sauce and the blue cheese this time around has changed, but rather a GOOD change. The old blue cheese was a delicious side that had a nice milder tang yet plentiful thick chunks of blue cheese. The New blue cheese seems to be more tangy, yet smoother and the same amount of blue cheese. All in all nicely prepared and well worth the money every time. I like to tip a little extra from time to time whenever I have spare cash on me just to show them that I really do appreciate their hard work and going above and beyond to deliver to my house on time or before the time they say, all while being friendly once they get here.

Sort of like a fast food place, you order your food at the counter and then they'll call you up when your order is ready. There's complimentary water and you pick up your utensils too. I chose the Mega Bowl ($12.50) as it seemed to be the biggest portion. I'm not sure if it's a limited time offer, but extra rice is free so I definitely did not pass up on that. 

The food came pretty quickly and it was a lot of food. The teriyaki chicken had a good flavour. The tempura was 2 pieces of prawn and yam, and was a big highlight for me. The prawn was moist and juicy. The tempura batter was quite light. The Minced pork and tofu with spicy sauce reminded me of mapo tofu. It was not very spicy at all, but had a nice kick. This went very well with the rice. Speaking of rice, this was a really generous portion of rice and I was definitely full by the end of my meal.

I came here looking for a good slice of pizza and they did not disappoint! One of my pet peeves is when people load up on the meat without regard for balance. The result is that your ""meat lovers"" turns more into a ""salt lovers"" pizza.  

It was Monday so I had to try their peach-bacon slice of pizza. As weird as it sounded, the acidity of the peach balanced out the taste of the bacon and it was pretty good! 

The restaurant itself was very space, cool and clean. There were also pinball machines and board games available to play, which contributed to kind of a neon ""80s"" vibe to it. The retro atmosphere is much appreciated.

A typical slice of pizza here runs for 4.50 or so which I think is pretty high. And just one slice definitely won't fill you up :(

Fortunately they do have happy hours, deals for PSU students and lunch specials. You can get a tasty breadstick, a slice and a *real* soda (I.e. Made with real sugar) for 8 bucks.

Tip: If trying to come during rush hour use the Chipotle App early in the morning to have it available on time.

Is being too good a bad thing!?:
So I saw a portion of lower rated reviews for this Chipotle had to do with long lines. Long lines occur if you come during rush hour of course, and should be expected! From 12:00pm to 1:30pm it's slammed. Are you going to wait awhile? Yep! Do people wait? Yep! People wait because this Chipotle is pretty much the best one in Orlando. Really consistent on making amazing chicken that is always more flavorful and never burnt like other places I've been to. Overall more flavorful, and the staff are really cool people.

Food is always great here!
Food is always flavorful and great tasting, and I've been going here for years. Best chicken and rice served here in my opinion! 

Interior is clean!
They do a good job on cleaning tables, taking out trash, managing the utensils bar. Overall always been a pleasure to come eat here due to it being clean and well supplied. 

Staff is really nice!
If you ever have a problem they handle it without question. I never had a problem, but I've seen some slight hiccups with customers. I would say it wasn't Chipotle staff's fault at all, but the customers being unclear. To my surprise management accepted the blame and then even went even further to fix the problem by giving free food. Utterly stunned, and my perspective of chipotle is extremely positive on how well they treat their customers.

The line just moves so slow!! I'm writing this review while standing in line. There were only 5 people in front of me, but between each live customer, they work on an online order that consists of 6-8 different things. So in practice it's like 5 people + (6 ~8 x 5 = 30~40) orders being processed in front of you. I've been in line for 20 minutes already and I still haven't ordered.

This is due to the horrible implementation of the online ordering system. They really need dedicated, separate employees for online vs live orders. 

I could just order online too, but in my experience, Chipotle online orders tend to have less food in it then when you have them make it in front of you.

The sauces they have here mimic your traditional Chinese fare. The plum sauce is duck sauce and the mustard sauce is similar to the average Chinese hot mustard sauce but a little thicker.

Overall. Good stuff. I scarfed it down. Standard Cobb. Egg, bacon, and I added chicken. I swapped out the Ranch that comes with it for their spicy miso dressing and it was a great choice. The dressing tasted like the chipotle mayo at Subway, which I love.

First of all, the women that was behind the counter was flirting with a customer, which is not the problem...but she ignored the fact that there was a line forming behind him...a line that reached 3 people already. As she was talking to him, she was also texting on her cellphone. 

He ended up getting a sandwich and was very nice to him. Once she turned around to service my brother and I, she was completely rude, wasn't listening to what we were ordering, and made a mess everywhere. She threw the knives in the wrong area, didn't change her gloves, threw those baskets for those who eat in on the floor, and was a complete b****. It was realllly messy in there, there was sauce everywhere, crumbs, meat.... We were VERY patient, and didn't complain.

As she was making our sandwiches, she decided to restock everything, but didn't apologize at the fact that she had to do that or say ""i'll be right back"" or ""excuse me."" She just left a line of people standing there (the line grew to about 6 people at this point). After she restocked everything, she looked at us and was like ""well what else?"" As she made my sandwich, her phone rang, which she picked up and had a conversation with the person on the other line. She said ""you want anything else or what?"" and as I answered, she spoke on the phone- leaving out my pickles and cucumbers might I add. 

When she rung us out, she swiped the card, and walked away...no word.

First time at an SnS in almost 15 years and not a great ""welcome back."" We just flew to CBus and I thought I'd take my boy there for a late night (Sunday at 11:30 pm) snack and intro him to a decent burger. We dined in and, upon arrival, noticed there were three tables of 4 already sat. Took a few minutes to sit us but that's okay. I'll fast forward to the conclusion here: we arrived at 11:30. At 12:10 am, we finally got one burger (with fries) and a very basic iceberg lettuce salad with chicken tenders on it. 40 minutes. I also ordered some bowls of chili and a turkey sandwich to go for others in my party but never got those because at that point, I just asked for the burger and salad to be packaged up for take-out. I couldn't wait any longer.

Let's dispense with the food quality: garlic burger was so heavily doused with garlic butter that you couldn't taste anything else. And super greasy. Cajun fries had inconsistent seasoning (heavy in parts and too light in other parts). The ""fried chicken"" salad was meh at best. Luke warm tenders with heavy breading and basic greasy spoon style side salad. And no, I don't come here expecting gourmet food. But at least decent, and especially since they advertise one of their core competencies to be burgers. 

In the restaurant's defense, the server kept telling me she was the only one serving all tables (four of them including us) + the drive through. There was one cook and a third person claiming she only worked in the back but didn't appear to me to be helping out much. So I get you can be behind when you're slammed. I've worked in food service at a full service restaurant before and I didn't really see this as a slammed dining room. And I think the other staffers could have contributed more to make this a better customer experience. And I would also cut this place a break if this is an isolated incident for me. But, based on prior reviews, this seems to be a theme for this place. I'd hope that the management would take this feedback and staff their late shifts better.

Decided on a kid's meal of the teriyaki chicken over noodles.. which the picture on their food selector shows a chicken breast with teriyaki sauce slathered on the outside of it. Got the three chicken pot stickers on the side. Just over $7
Got home and opened the bowl of lo mein with chicken to find it a soup of teriyaki. The gal had asked if I wanted the sauce on the side... now I know why. It was chicken... bathed in the sauce, to kind of overwhelm the lack of flavoring on the actual noodles. Yuck.
So I decided to eat the chicken after leaving most of the sauce onto a napkin and enjoy the pot stickers... except their exterior had hardened to the point of being very un-edible. Geez. What a waste of money.",2017-04-02 12:24:25

-food served fast.
-affordable prices.
-tasty fried food. 

I've ordered and personally demolished the following items in the past few weeks:

1) Deluxe Curry on Rice (5/5)
This is my favorite dish to get so far, however you better proceed with caution unless if you want a nice nap afterwards. There are 2 pieces of ebi tempura, deep fried pork cutlet, an egg, with the Japanese curry bringing it all together on top of rice. The tempura and pork cutlet are both fried well. This is a simple, hearty meal that you cannot go wrong with.

2) Meat Curry on Rice (3/5)
This dish is similar to the Deluxe Curry dish above. The major difference is that there's only sliced beef, deep fried pork culet, and curry over rice. The sliced beef is mediocre and the curry overshadows the beef. 

3) Mega Bowl (4/5)
If you're someone who loves variety, wants to try all the items on the menu, and appreciates affordable pricing, then the Mega Bowl is for you. This bowl contains teriyaki chicken, mixed tempura, spicy tofu, salad, and rice. The spicy tofu acts as a delicious ""sauce"" or ""curry"" on top of the rice. The teriyaki chicken is dry but there's good flavor. And, do not fret, there are greens with mayo on top so you'll definitely get your fiber intake! 

The ingredients are not the highest quality. However, at the end of the day, with great prices and tasty food, Ebi-Ten does not disappoint. I will continue to come back!",2020-09-18 23:34:48

Here's what you do: order a jumbo char dog (yes, it's a little pricey for a hot dog...it's a big hot dog, and it's worth it).  Get it with CHICAGO style fixins, not chili/cheese.  Go all out with the whole shebang if that's your thing.  (I keep it simpler with mustard, onions, and sport peppers.  No, extra sport peppers.  And maybe a pickle if I'm feeling frisky.)  Then order a small fries with cheese sauce.  You do not need a large...trust me, you will hate yourself for it.

I usually make it as far as the Canoe Plaza before leaving the Turnpike for the theme parks or to visit my daughter in Winter Park. The Turkey Lake rest stop has both north and south bound entrances. It is named after nearby Turkey lake which contains Bill Frederick Park. 

Food options here include vending machines, Dunkin Donuts, KFC, Nathans, Nature's Table, Villa Pizza, and Wendy's. There is the typical Sunshine market where you can pick up your sundries. Of course there are restrooms which is why you likely stopped as well as a picnic area. You can stock up on your tourist brochures which every kid likes to do in anticipation of fun destinations on a road trip. There is also expensive gas to refuel your vehicle. 

Normally I prefer a turnpike rest area to the ones on I-95. The reason for my one star is they don't require masks even though there are recommendations to wear one on the door. How can you not require masks at a place that has people coming through from all parts of Florida? I would like to note that the workers inside are wearing masks. Every day the number of cases of Covid is rising in Florida as is the death rate. It was upsetting to see hardly anyone walking in with a mask. No thanks. I don't want to be standing next to other non mask wearing people in the tight confines of the bathroom. Shame on the transportation authorities for not requiring masks for people entering the building. The more open plans of the I-95 bathroom rest areas is a better bet right now. The only turkeys I saw here today were the selfish non mask wearing people. Let's get it together Florida because it is going to take all of us.",2020-07-19 12:23:36

Your experience here will likely depend on WHO is working.

When the RIGHT people work:
-orders are accurate 
-packaged in a way reasonable to carry that keeps food in good shape 
-nice people
-front counter staff who might even remember your order from last time!

When the WRONG people work:
-inaccurate orders (including allergens!)
-you feel like a pack mule trying to leave with 5 bags/containers of food
-you get home and food is smashed
-you can't open those plastic containers (if they are on wrong, they are very hard to open.)
-they take any opportunity to say snotty things (I don't care if you think I should have brought my bag back from last time. I don't care if you think I should have ordered this one thing of guacamole online to limit exposure.)
-they police salsas like you are asking them for money (you are allowed 3 per item ordered according to the web site)
-you find yourself wondering why you bothered to go here when you knew this might happen

In my experience, there has been one woman primarily working the front counter during the Coronavirus situation. She is THE WORST OF THE WORST.

Scoring this review is hard because sometimes it's a 5 (especially pre-virus) and sometimes it is a zero. However since I have decided to go elsewhere many times because I don't want to deal with the wrong people working, I went with a 1.

I was greeted while perusing the menu up on the wall.  When I was ready to order, I noticed my original server had floated off and been replaced by another wraith-like individual.  This person took my order and proceeded to ask only what ingredients I wanted in my lime-chicken burrito a la Chipotle.  I was not once looked in the eye and not once asked if I wanted anything else to add to my order.

My burrito was only mildly OK.  There was a small essence of lime in the chicken that did not last for long.  When I get lime chicken enchiladas at Chez Jose, the taste of lime is appropriately intense and lasts throughout the meal.  The cheese sauce was made from American cheese and tasted funky.  All ingredients were terribly bland and dry.

There were three to four un-bussed tables piled high with wrappers and trays while the two employees either sat and ate their dinner or replenished their beverage.  Only one other customer came in while I was dining.

I found the emphasis on the catering side of their business very strong.  There are scads of catering pamphlets scattered throughout the restaurant.  One whole restaurant window was taken up by a display of a faux catering setup.  This must be where they make their money; they cannot possibly be making money on the restaurant side with the low quality of the food and extremely poor customer service and appearance of the restaurant.

Gotta admit, this was one of those places you wish would open within walking distance to your house - it was really that good!  The employees were very friendly, and although it's small and there's limited seating, I was able to stuff myself, my food, my beer, and heaps of snowboard gear all into a corner with no problems.

I walk in and two cashiers, one was the manager taking two guys orders and the other was directly under the sign for phoned in orders, so I followed their marks on the floor and went to that one. Next thing I hear is the manager bellowing loud enough for the whole neighborhood to hear that I needed to get in line and wait my turn. She kept telling me how the guys were there first, like who did I think I was? 
I told her I had already paid my order and was there to pick it up, pointing at the directional marks on the floor. She told me to get in the back of the line. So that seems like a well thought out process, to jam people into a confined space instead of moving people through as quickly as possible. And why do they take orders online if they are still going to make a customer wait until people in the store place their orders? 
She finally managed to give me my items, but they didn't bother reading the order because it was incorrect. And I was given a bunch of stuff to juggle getting to my car, put them in a bag already! None Of the necessities like napkins, so had to ask for those and the Manager then made me wait for her to take someone else's order to give them to me. 
Finally there's a sign saying due to the current situation, they would only give 2 salsas per order. COVID isn't a food shortage issue, and it's not an issue at other locations.  They also have their drink fountain open so people can drink out of their cups and go back to the machine to refill, which does create a high risk transmission issue. The other locations have signs saying no refills. 
I finally get everything needed to leave and start to go back out the door I came in and she stopped and bellowed again that I need to use the other door. Bless her heart, PUT UP SIGNS AND OFFER DIRECTIVES! stop yelling at your customers, we do not read your mind on how you want things done.

Chicken teriyaki (lightly seasoned)
Mega bowl (as above with tofu and minced pork added)

The food, as indicated above, was decent. The dining room was non-descript -- typical fast food restaurant. Service was adequate but not memorable.

We took transit into downtown, so I know nothing about parking around there -- except that I would hate to have to park down there.

Well, it was because it was different from a typical mall food court restaurant. Usually food courts have one restaurant for each type of cuisine (ex. Mexican, burgers, Chinese, sandwiches, etc.). Steamers seemed to be a surprising option to be found in Portland. You would think that there would be restaurants this in larger town like Seattle, unfortunately this is a no. I would love to personally see Steamers or a restaurant like this up here in the Seattle area.

The menu is simple consisting of four main options. Spring rolls, pad thai, dumplings and bao (bun). The first two items are likely to be found in a Thai restaurant while the later two are found in Chinese restaurant and prevalent in a dim sum restaurant. The pad thai is pedestrian and you would be better off going to an authentic Thai restaurant. But the dumplings and bao make Steamers a good place to go. 

There are four dumplings option including ginger pork, Szechuan chicken, chicken mushroom and spinach glass noodle.There are also four bun options including hoisin pork, curry vegetable, sweet azuki and coconut custard.

Dumplings are priced based on the number of dumplings you order ($4 for 4, $5 for 8, $5.69 for 12) and can add one bun for $.59 additional or two for $.99 more. A la carte price for the bun so it makes sense to order it with the dumplings if you want one.

The dumplings itself are a nice change of pace from the dumplings I am used to eating at Chinese restaurants especially the spicy Szechuan chicken. I would also suggest the chicken mushroom. I have had two of the buns, the hoisin pork which as good as any Chinese dim sum place I have visited and the curry vegetable which was pretty good also.

When it comes to being able to find a good place to get good, quick, and fairly priced burgers and dogs, there really only is this one place. Anywhere else I've gone or had delivered is always like $12 for a hamburger that is just rubbish, but not here.

The prices are really good for what you get and being in Boulder near campus it's more than acceptable. Everything that they have on the menu is priced incredibly well, and the descriptions on the menu is exactly what you get. There is no fluff ingredients or 5 or 6 slices of tomatoes with half a head of lettuce to make things look big. You choose the toppings and get exactly that.

I very often leave incredibly full and having only spent like $10. Everything that I have ever had, has been fantastic, Namely the ""Ditka"" which is massive in size, and perfectly flavored, claiming to be 1/3 lb, but It seems way more than that closer to 1/2 lb. They use high quality ingredients and it certainly shows in the food. Everything has that nice grill flavor that we all love and even the smallest hamburger is cooked to a perfect medium rare, even after its delivered and been in a car for its journey through Boulder lunch traffic, its still cooked to temperature and hot.

 I highly recommend stopping in here if you need a quick burger or hot dog without any of the run around menu. What you think is usually what you get.",2017-04-23 04:40:33

New restaurants are constantly popping up all over the Columbus area. There are also many places that have been here for a long time but seem to take that for granted, but not Chick-fil-A!

Chick-fil-A started in 1946 as the Dwarf Grill in Hapeville, Georgia.  In 1961 the name was changed to Chick-fil-A.  The first Chick-fil-A opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall in Atlanta, GA.

Every Chick-fil-A that I have ever been to treats the customers with care, and truly appreciates that you are eating at their restaurant.  This location goes above and beyond to make sure that you have a fantastic experience.  

I eat out a lot and find that most places seem to care but not really.  Today I had the best experience ever and I wanted to share it with everybody.

We arrived a few minutes before noon on Tuesday April 2, 2019.  The line for the drive thru was wrapped around the building, which is normal for this location.  The parking lot was nearly full, but we found a place to park.  As we entered the building a worker was wiping the windows down and greeted us with a genuine hello and a smile.  The line to place an order was 3 rows deep which seems like it would take forever to get through the line, but they have about 5 registers open and the line moves really fast.

Our order taker was friendly, cheerful and seemed to really care about being there and helping us with our order.  He answered all of our questions and was very helpful with taking our order.  The order process was flawless!  I appreciated that they weren't stingy with the dipping sauces and let us choose several different kinds.

We headed toward the dining room to find a table and and as we were sitting down two employees came over to assist.

One brought over a high chair and removed the regular chair and the the other rolled out the red carpet for us.  She put a disposable placement down along with Purell wipes for the little one and then she brought us napkins, plastic ware, and ketchup.

We were totally impressed with the level of service today.

We didn't even have to go back up for drink refills as somebody came by later to refill our drinks and get a to-go back for some leftovers.

Order:
Kids meal - 4 piece nuggets, fruit and apple juice.
Cobb Salad with spicy chicken.
Spicy chicken sandwich with fries & drink.

Everything was fresh, and tasted great.
Thanks Chick-fil-A making us feel both welcomed and appreciated.",2019-04-03 23:16:49

My husband and I came here for lunch on a Saturday around 12:30. It wasn't busy when we got there but did pick up while we were eating. 

First impressions: small parking lot and spaces for that matter! Inside the place there's not a lot of seating which I was a little surprised at. Seems like this is mostly a to go place by the set up. I really liked the idea of this place so was eager to try it. 

I got some kind of Mexican pita and husband got the chicken shawarma. It didn't take them long to make them and we sat down to eat. 

I didn't like how the pita is so thick and heavy. I thought it would've been a little thinner and I don't know, warm?! Both our pitas were almost ice cold and that was a huge disappointment. Being cold, it made them hard too. Maybe if they weren't cold the whole meal would've been better but I wasn't impressed with the quality of the ingredients. The lettuce was brown and wilted, chicken was grayish and chewy and the rest of the veggies weren't ripe or fresh- like the tomatoes were almost pale pinkish white and flavorless and not a vibrant, red. color like fresh tomatoes are. 

I ate 3 bites and pitched the rest of mine. My husband ate probably 75% of his but he said he wouldn't get it again and just ate it not to waste money and he was really hungry. 

I completely agree with the reviewer who said this is like the subway of pita places. Id pick subway any day over this place. Love the concept, but the end result just wasn't worth it and a total let down.",2013-08-15 15:56:00

There was a time in my life where I was a part-time vegan, so I'm fairly well versed in the variety of fake meats out there.  I've found that my body doesn't love soy, so I try to keep the amount I consume to a minimum, but hey, when in Rome, right?

I got the Thai salad and it was HUGE.  The sauce was very tasty, if not a bit salty (although I'm a bit sensitive to sodium so it could just be my personal preference).  The tempeh was well marinated and oh my wonton, there were a whole bunch of crispy bits in there!

Overall a really well balanced and filling salad.  Price was in line with the area, especially for the amount of food you get.  The only thing that annoyed me was that I got quite a few kale stems in my salad.  They didn't seem to do a good job of separating the leaves from the stems.

But we've gone to this Dairy Queen since it opened--until last Friday.  We placed a phone order for three burgers, a couple sides, and two ice creams.  Upon arrival to pick up our order, only one burger had been prepared.  The cook yelled to his co-worker that he didn't see the other two burgers on the order because ""...you covered it up!""  After having to wait while 2 more burgers were prepared, food arrived home.  Out of 3 burgers, none were correctly prepared.  Two were missing bacon (which we paid extra for) and two had onions and tomatoes when those items were asked to be left off.  All 3 burgers were cold (we live just 1 1/2 blocks away) and tasted as though they'd been sitting all day.  I'm not kidding.  I don't believe the buns had been warmed, and the burgers were squashed messes.  The fried cheese curds tasted like fish (I suspect they're cooked in the same rancid oil).  Fries were fine (I imagine it's pretty hard to mess up fries.)  For this we paid $30.

It's mostly fast food, reliant on processed meat/cheese substitutes and redolent with empty calories, and while it might be beloved by vegan customers who might not otherwise get to eat things like burgers and mac & cheese, as a non-vegan I wasn't impressed.

I got the Spicy Thai salad, which was expensive at $12 and IMO not worth the price (although was at least quite large). It was mostly very lightly dressed raw kale shreds (I thought I got a hint of non-spicy peanut dressing?), with a touch of quinoa and edamame, a bunch of crunchy wontons, and a large scoop of apricot-sriracha glazed seitan on top. Flavors were decent, but I wanted way more veggies, more dressing, more reliance on non-processed proteins (chickpeas, beans, quinoa), and a lower price. On the flip side, my vegan friend loved her Whiskey BBQ sandwich and sweet potato fries with beet ketchup, and enjoyed the matcha muffin although felt it was a bit too crumbly. 

The delicious bowls from both b. good and Whole Heart Provisions are actually crave-worthy to me and keep me coming back, but I don't see anything here to make me want to return- especially not the service (my server literally just wandered away after putting in my order, and I wasn't sure if the transaction was completed, or what).

Our party of 6 decided to eat here for our dear friend's bachelorette party. We were visiting from Houston and the restaurant was close to our hotel. We were seated and as our server, Ashlyn, began to take our food order she began to explain a ""new rule"" the manager is implementing for patrons that are not seating in the bar area. The rule is, ""if you dont order an entree, one must order an appetizers and side item to balance out the cost of the entree."" The reason for this was that they are having a hard time with patrons coming in and only eating the bread and drinking water and then leaving STK without paying for a meal.  
Here comes the problem. We had made our reservations back in April. While I understand, the act of other patrons is causing this business to lose monies, we should have been made aware of this ""new rule"" when they confirmed our visit. 
When we asked to speak to the manager,Zac, about this issue and we were told my Ashlyn that it will be fine for us this time? WTF? Not once during our meal did Zac come by and speak with us regarding this issue. It was dinner time and we came to eat prior to a night of partying for the bride to be. I've never felt more embarrassed and insulted in my life. No one likes to be told how to spend their money and how to order food. 
I will be calling STK corporate office to air my grievances against this location. 
Furthermore, I will advise everyone that I know about this experience and suggest them to find another place to enjoy a meal and speak their money without being told what to do because of a ""new rule"". I could go on but I am choosing not to.

Well, I don't really think it's my type of steakhouse either.  STK Atlanta is located in the Loews Hotel on Peachtree St.  It has a swanky lounge/club feel.  I am most definitely not a swanky lounge/club type of person.  I came here for a business dinner with 5 other people.  

I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early.  The host informed me that I was the first of the group to arrive and to let him know when the entire group was here.  They have these huge white wavy benches so I took a seat and scoped out the place.  It was pretty empty when I got there.  A large group of women arrived shortly after me and sat near me on the benches.  I guess they were missing people from their group as well.  The rest of my group arrived and we moved to the bar because our table wasn't ready.  I'm not sure why the table wasn't ready as there were only two tables seated in the entire place.  We sat there for about 15 minutes and the host stopped by to take us to our table.  It was a pretty big booth that seated 5 comfortably and one in a chair at the end of the table.

Soon after placing our orders, two platters of bread were brought to the table. It was pull apart bread covered in this cheesy sauce.  It was served with this green liquidy dip.  I'm not quite sure what it was.  I tried one piece of bread.  It was pretty good.  Salty and cheesy.

I started off with the blue iceberg.  It's their version of the wedge salad.  It's stuffed with blue cheese and topped with bacon and blue cheese dressing.  As much as I hate to say this, I thought that it had too much blue cheese.  I love the stuff but it was way overpowering.  I ate less than half of the salad due to the excess blue cheese.  The guy sitting next to me ordered the roasted beet salad.  That actually looked a lot better than my wedge.  

The table shared the baked oysters as an appetizer.  They came out baked with spinach, gremolata, and bacon and served on a bed of salt.  It was a lot of green stuff.  I just had one oyster.  I'm not the biggest oyster fan, but it was decent.

The steak menu is split into small, medium, and large.  I went with a steak on the small menu - a 6 oz. filet medallion.  I ordered it medium and it came out cooked perfectly.  The steaks come with a sauce.  I ordered the STK sauce on the side.  It's kind of like a sweet steak sauce.  I didn't really eat it with the steak.  I also got an order of sauteed mushrooms as my side item.  There was a nice variety of types of mushrooms in the dish and they went well with the steak.

I wasn't going to order dessert but everyone else ordered desserts.  So, I succumbed to peer pressure and got a peanut butter ball.  It's this huge ball of chilled creamy peanut butter covered in hard chocolate.  Vanilla ice cream and a caramelized banana are served on the side.  I actually thought that this was the best part of the meal.  It was not too rich and a perfect ending to the meal.

Our server did a great job during the meal.  The only bad part of the service were all the other people working the table other than our main server.  After each course, all of the utensils were cleared away along with the plates and new ones were put down.  The only problem was that they couldn't quite reach all of the place settings so we had to help them out or they kept reaching over the entire table to put down the new utensils.  One time they reached over my salad plate and got a bit too cozy with my food.  Fortunately, I had already finished eating my salad.  I also find it awkward for the staff to interrupt your conversation to ask you to hand him your used utensils.  Service is supposed to be unobtrusive.  I'm not supposed to notice you.  I would prefer not to see you put your belly in my salad or ask me to hand you the knife and fork of the guy sitting next to me.  Water service was also not up to par.  There were empty water glasses several times during the meal.  I was drinking Pellegrino that evening and the guy refilling the water kept trying to put flat water in my glass even though the big Pellegrino bottle was sitting next to my glass.  And my glass had bubbles.  I had to keep waving him off.  At the end of the meal, I failed to warn him off and he filled my half glass of bubbly water with tap water.  Ugh.

The meal was okay, but not worthy of me venturing out to this meat market for a steak.",2013-01-29 03:14:24

It was immediately apparent STK is ""not your Daddy's steakhouse"" when the old school sounds of Aerosmith's ""Walk this Way"" came blaring out onto Peachtree Street as we entered. (There's an actual DJ in the corner spinning records.)

The decor is quite nice, loud '80s club music notwithstanding. I especially love the seating area in the dining room, where sumptuous leather banquets are curved inward to facilitate conversation. The crowd is young, beautiful, and dressed to the nines. Ditto the wait staff. Our server, Kristin, guided our table expertly through the menu to the strains of ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" and provided great recommendations for our steaks and sides. The runners bringing the food were also knowledgeable, explaining the types of oysters and the various sauces provided.

And oh, those oysters! Pristine, tasty morsels of briny goodness. Delicious on their own, both the mignonette sauce and the cocktail sauce add great flavor. ($30 gets you an even dozen of these beauties.)

On Kristin's advice, we opted for the 20-ounce bone-in ribeye, and it did not disappoint. Cooked to medium rare, these gorgeously crusted steaks delivered mouthfuls of pure beef bliss. (Bonus - we took the bones home to make beef stock.) One sauce is included with the steak. We tried the horseradish and the STK sauce, which tastes a little like a sweetened A1. Stick with the horseradish. Or opt for a more decadent topping, like foie gras butter, for an additional charge.

The sides were quite good, and a nice accompaniment to the steak. We ordered four for the table: haricot verts; roasted salsify; parmesan truffle fries; and the mushroom pot pie. [Note: the oysters, steak, haricot verts, salsify and fries are gluten free, as are most of the steak sauces and toppings. STK doesn't offer a separate menu, but the staff will work with you to find safe menu options.]

STK is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, but I'm not quite sure about the nightclub + fine dining concept. On the night we visited, the bar area was practically empty and there weren't too many people in the dining room doing the L.A. Reid chair dance to a steady stream of hits from thirty years ago. For every cool Smiths and Talking Heads track, there are at least a dozen Rick Astley or Howard Jones disasters. The hipster lounge atmosphere might work better on the weekend, or when the bar is crowded and lively. Perhaps I'm just not the target demographic. Either way, the food and the service are worth the splurge. Prepare to spend between $90-110 per person, cocktails and wine included.",2012-01-06 15:12:38

Anyway, Im a vegetarian so my options were limited, but that was expected. The king salmon was great. Right amount of seasoning and cooked to perfection.

The sides were on the small side, since they claimed it was family size...there weren't.

Two of the people in our party were going to split the porterhouse.  However when it came out, it had a charcoal taste.  Not like an over cooked taste, but a lighter fluid taste.  Like when you start charcoal and don't wait for it to burn down.  They sent it back and tried to explain to the manager, but he was a bit defensive and said that's how they are cooked.  I'm not sure if he understood that there was a lighter fluid taste.  They ordered two filets in its place, they were just ok.  I LOVE a good steak.  The price was not the issue, the quality for the price was.  For a place known for their steaks, you just expect more.  Maybe we got a bad cook.

There was a decent selection of wines and drinks, but they tended to be on the pricey side, even for Midtown ($14 and up). I went for a manhattan and my wife had wine. Good, but not great.

The appetizers were ok. The salad was pretty deconstructed and had literally whole leaves of romaine lettuce drizzled with dressing. The octopus salad was mostly beans. Meh.

The main course was very well cooked and thin sliced steak. It was the best of the dishes that we had. The sauce served on the side was delicious too. I only wish there were more of the mashed potatoes.

Dessert, also meh. Decent but somewhat heavy cobbler. Chocolate mousse withou that much flavor.

Overall, this is an interesting place, and it was good at one thing that it claims to be good at: steak. However, it was a little bit loud and maybe (?) too trendy, if there is such a thing, and the other courses didn't pay off.",2016-10-02 01:23:49

My water glass was never empty, I never had to ask for another napkin, and suggestions were made before I could even ask. Being a former server, I couldn't believe how well Bobby handled our group.

We ordered the seafood platters, thick-cut bacon (by suggestion -- YUM!) and short rib & leek ravioli (to die for). Bobby made sure we didn't over order and had the perfect amount of food (something you don't often see, since servers always try to upsell you, especially in large groups).

The other runners made sure our utensils were constantly changed for each course and our meals came out altogether (and in record time for such a large group). The teamwork was impeccable, but I highly suggest asking for Bobby!

From the oversized, dark suited ""doorman"" bedecked with a mysterious ear-piece to the over-cologned guys with wedding ring tan lines to the dude wearing gold chains and unironic Ed Hardy, the restaurant was redolent with douche. The women didn't seem much better, with giggles and Cosmos and countless Spanx straining against low self-esteem. These are the kind of women that refer to Entertainment Tonight as ""the news"" and desperately wants a gay best friend because being a vapid bitch is so much more palatable when being filtered through a sassy homosexual. (And don't get me started on the Cosmos. What year is this? I might as well have shown up in Hammer pants.)

I'm being unfair, I know. Some of these people could've been very nice. Hell, an actual friend of mine LOVES STK (though she did warn me, ""it's not exactly your crowd, but at least you'll like the food."") Despite all this, I couldn't shake the feeling I was drinking in a Brett Easton Ellis novel.

So how WAS the food? It was fine. I'd ordered the short rib and it was soft and velvety as a well-braised short rib ought to be. I was pleasantly surprised that the portions were fairly generous. The mushroom pot pie was just damn good. The service was personable though I took note that our server suggested one of the more expensive bottles of wine when asked. (Oh thank you, Mr. Upsell. I guess coffee AND an unctuous pinot are for closers.)  But once I began to view the mating dance between that newly divorced guy holding  desperately onto his increasingly thinning hair and that girl ""whose friends all seem to be dudes because she's just one of the guys and, oh yeah, she used to dance, but oh no, not THAT kind of dancing...well, ok, maybe for like a year or two, but only to pay for college and, oh?

This place is in the fast casual category, they text you when your order is ready and the inside has a very clean look. Found the prices to be reasonable for the area ($10ish range) and thought the pastries were a bargain. Here is what I tried:

Vegan Lobster Roll - It is a Boston special menu item. Essentially it is heart of palm with smoked paprika. It more has the look of a lobster roll than the taste of one but good nonetheless. I was really impressed with the bread they use too.

Guac Burger - A great vegan burger, and again, as a meat eater I found this really great. Especially if you like guacamole. Again, the bread used was also excellent and the burger itself had enough crunch to it where I didn't feel like I was eating mushed veggies.

Pesto Meatball Sub - Probably not healthy from a calorie perspective compared to other menu items but it sure was delicious. It has a few sauces on it that make it a little messy but it's so good it's worth it. Tied for the Guac Burger for my favorite entree.

Vegan Hostess Cupcake - Virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. You will be just as surprised as I was. A must get item!

The guac burger was also just as delicious, if you're into that black bean quinoa sweet potato patty sort of thing. The Mac and cheese will blow your mind. You wouldn't even be able to tell that it wasn't cheese. The only downside was that my shiitake bacon was definitely burnt, and although it was a great side, it was just a tad overwhelming for me.

This week I have to say I was greatly disappointed. The East Coast oysters were good (not over rinsed like most places make the mistake of doing), the brussel sprouts every loved, even those who said they don't like them. My ribeye steak was sub-par. I don't think the chef realizes that even though you are going with one of their (expensive) toppings, you still have to season the meat. My steak was tasteless! Even with my special topping. The ""special"" bread pudding pear dessert was nothing special according to 2 of us, but everyone liked their chocolate dessert (and yes, you can mess up chocolate). 
I can only hope our clients pick another restaurant next time as I think the food is now way over-priced for the quality.

I also had the chicken and the sides greatly overpriced and the flavors were good but not enough at the price  but hey we do pay for Brands but Quality is what we expect in any Brand.  Automatic 20% gratuity isnt bad but i still tipped and they changed or waiters twice.  Then The Icing on the cake was when I went to retrieve my car the Guy caucasion guy to be exact I gave him 2 seperate tickets and paid for both and before I even got the cars he said to me I quote ""Hey give me a nice tip"" and i am thinking first I never even got my car or the other car and he asked me for a tip  which isn't great practice because I'm use to tipping once I get my car.

I wanted an restaurant that was upscale, but modern, hip vibe with an younger crowd (28 - 39). I figured a Friday night at STK couldn't disappoint and I was right! I had a fantastic time. 

We had a later reservation but decided to arrive about 30 minutes earlier and the host quickly accommodated us. We were seated in a lovely booth with plenty of space to enjoy. I kept thinking how great the space would be for a double date too!The food and drinks were excellent and moderately priced. I'm used to paying Manhattan prices for bespoke cocktails, but I found the price point was appropriate at ~$14. I had the duck, while my boyfriend had the salmon. We both enjoyed our entrees very much - so we didn't share :)

The manager also brought my boyfriend and I complimentary birthday shots! Our waiter Charles was an absolute delight and very accommodating. He took a couple pictures for us and knew the menu and cocktail list backwards and forwards. 

The only reason I'm not giving STK Atlanta 5 stars is because on a Friday night around 8-9pm I was expecting a much more lively experience. A couple tables were empty.

First, I'll get my disappointment out of the way. The establishment has velvet parking. However, what they don't tell you or post in a visible area is there's complimentary 2 hour parking if you get your ticket stamped by the host. Now for the good stuff. STK is well designed with superb ambiance. The lighting is a bit dim, but overall it really fits the decor and the seating is very comfortable and relaxing. Next highlight is the food. The place prides itself on being a steakhouse and surely lives up to it. I was pleasantly surprised by the skirt steak. It had good flavor and cooked to temperature. Their lobster Mac n cheese was tasty, but it did have a sweet undertone I didn't care for however I'm sure the lobster contributed to it. We also had the creamed spinach which was good with the consistency of a spinach artichoke dip w/o the artichoke of course. I ordered the 10 oz bone-in filet and was not disappointed at all. The first attempt it was just a tad over cooked, this is where kudos is attributed to our attendant but I won't digress. The second attempt was spot on. The steak was well seasoned and the beef was tender and flavorful. Honestly, the filet is listed at 10oz, but it looked more like 12oz which was awesome in itself. Now for the best part of our experience. From start to finish, our attendant, Ashlyn, was phenomenal. Really, I cannot come up with a word to describe how gracious and attentive she was towards us. We dine out a lot!!! And all I can say is Ashlyn is by far the best waiter we've ever experienced! She went above and beyond the call of a waiter to ensure our dining experience exceeded any expectation we could imagine. I'm sure this sounds over the top, but I kid you not, I'm understating her hospitality. When I received my first steak, she did not hesitate to take it back and request another one expedited to me while all along apologetic for the error. And to take it further, we didn't have to raise an eyebrow before the manager came over to express his concerns over the matter.

It's a bit dark inside with candles at every table so it's perfect for blind dates too (lol) especially if you had a long week & you're afraid your date might key in on the dark bags under your eyes.

My husband & I decided to come on a Saturday night & although it was fairly busy, the attentiveness of our server (Ashlyn) & other staff were spot on.

We ordered the half a dozen of oysters & calamari to start. My husband doesn't normally like oysters, but he ate half of my half a dozen. I was a bit upset about it because there were AMAZING. The calamari was just as delish. 

They give you complimentary bread as well, but we barely touched it because by the time we finished our starters, our food arrived which was awesome.

I ordered the glazed short ribs & hubby ordered their 16oz sirloin with mac & cheese for the side. That mac & cheese was soooo good, I accepted defeat & admitted that it is way better than mine that I make at home. Yum!

For dessert I couldn't decide so our server Ashlyn (super awesome chick btw) recommended the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. That was the cherry on top of a great meal.

The food is good, but, I unfortunately have to compare it to Chipotle. They don't get anywhere near Chipotles commitment to fresh and healthy ingredients. I believe that you can even taste the difference in their burritos. All of Chipotles ingredients are cooked right in front of you but you often see Qdoba reheating their meats in microwaves. Also, their production line needs to be faster, they should simply keep a larger staff rather than let the line go out the door. Sometimes you're waiting a full 30 min to order for a line that I feel should be manageable (so avoid the lunch and dinner rushes). Prices aren't terrible but I do wish they were a bit cheaper.

Qdoba does have some slightly different menu options from Chipotle that are nice like the queso sauce, which really improves the burrito. But there's a lot more to it than just taste, after all even McDonald's tastes good.

I should mention that this is the only Qdoba I have been to but I can't help but admit that they fall short of Chipotle in service and quality of food. I really feel that they could and should do better.",2014-08-25 18:52:07

I will say this, you have to like a sub that is steamed if you are going to like Firehouse Subs.

While the price to quantity ratio is very, very, off- I believe that by CHLOE has a great twist on plant-based food. The food is very unique and delicious, especially since we don't find restaurants of its kind in Texas. 

Environment and atmosphere is super cute! Accessible outlets, plenty of open seating, and pretty clean. Definitely a place where you can sit down and pull out your laptop if need be.

The Pesto Meatball- a MUST get. The ""cheeze"" sauce and Parmesan flakes tasted so cheesy! Meatballs melt in your mouth- They're not too ""meaty"" like alternative meat, meatballs, but they're a nice balance between a vegetable and meat based meatball. Bread is AMAZING (on all of their sandwiches actually)

The Classic Burger- This was good, but perhaps the Guac burger may be a better choice! I didn't want to get the Guac Burger because it seemed heavier, so got this instead. Overall a delicious burger, but the patty was not super flavorful. 

Mac and Cheese- If you're not a fan of smoky flavors ( I am not) then try to get this without the mushroom bacon, since that gives it a quite smoky flavor! This was worth trying, but not worth the price.

The Thai Salad- I was very excited to try this, however, my salad had literally NO greens and was 75% marinated thai tofu and crispy wontons. Not a good experience...

STK by contrast has bartenders and servers who are condescending, unhelpful and snarky...basically, STK has mean girls (especially the males).

It's amazing, for one, and includes your choice of two sides and an entree off of a sixteen-item menu. They're very lose with what they classify as a ""side."" While they list your classic side options like fries and onion rings here, they also somehow think that chicken nuggets and corn dogs are sides as well...I'm not complaining, more fried food options for me!

I ordered the chicken strips as my entree (different from the chicken nuggets) with sides of fries and a corn dog. Save for maybe popeyes, I thought they were as good as any other fast food chicken that I've had. I couldn't complain about the fries and corndog, either.

In addition to the incredible value, their endless list of milkshakes is what makes this place what it is. From peanut butter bannana, to mint oreo, to your basic chocolate and vanilla classics, they have just about every flavor that you would want in a milkshake. Here, I made a mistake by going with the Reese's Cups shake. While the thickness was perfect, it's hard to do a shake with just reeses cups. Unless you dump a ton of them into the shake, reeses cups don't distribute very well across a milkshake. There were solid portions of the shake where I was mostly just tasting the vanilla ice cream.

The Oreo shake that I got a few quick tastes of, however, was one of the best I've ever had. Consider it a lesson learned for next time, which hopefully isn't too far off (Cookout corporate...open a location in D.C.!)",2015-02-20 03:27:34

Interior is roomy and open, with a lot of whimsical touches like swings and faux foliage. Very casual, ""minimalist"" feel with kitschy decor fitting for your typical millennial. The only reason I docked a star is because the interior was surprisingly messy - the table's weren't being wiped down, and plenty of seats had food/lettuce/etc scattered on them. 

I'm not vegan (by a long shot) but by Chloe does a great job of offering some pretty crave-able options for everyone. My guac burger was delicious - only objection was the texture was all pretty uniform. They try to add some variety with crunchy tortilla strips, but overall the best way to describe it was mushy - but delicious. Beet ketchup (is ketchup not vegan?) as well as their creamy vegan aioli. The bowls are massive portion wise, and probably a better deal in terms of bang for your buck. by Chloe also has a large selection of ($8-10) juices, and also whole coconuts if you like drinking your vita coco straight from the source.

Food came and one girls food was hard she ordered steak that was medium to medium rare and it was incredibly hard to chew all of us tried it and she stopped eating it after the first bite. My food was cold entirely and the glazed beef is my favorite. Another girl she ordered a filet  and literally it was just a small filet with sauce on the side on a white plate. No presentation what so ever. Another girls chicken was burnt so she barely ate that as well. I ordered a green tea and she never brought until  towards the end. No one finished their food. We waited literally an hour probably over an hour to be honest but we still smiled. Towards the end we were so disappointed and we saw the check it's gratuity added and for the service we received was not worth it.

We walked in to a ghost town of an Italian restaurant and were served up two watered down drinks.  Wow, thanks.

While sitting at the Italian dump, we observed several Michael Alig looking 1990's club kids coming in and out of STK.  Not sure if these people were the entertainment or the guests.  If the later, I hope that they have the duckets to keep this joint open for the long-term in this finicky town.

Definitely the only mexican place I ever go to nowadays. No more Taco Bell or Taco Time for me. I usually buy the 7"" special taco soft shell but they stopped that size and now the smallest is a 10"" special for $5.95. I guess bigger is better?

Taco Luis provides a lovely steamed taco soft shell which is then filled quickly and nicely with fresh ingredients of your choice. The beef is nicely minced with a good taste and it's not dripping with grease. I wish the guacamole were not pumped out of a can, but what can you expect with cheap fast food. Everything is wrapped up nicely and topped with fresh (usually hasn't been sitting out for a long time) tater-tots or mexi-fries.  I especially love their home-made (I'm not sure if it actually is) salsa/hot sauce. It has a different taste than anything else I've tried - less tomato and more onion and garlic?

Thursday's they have a DJ, so it may be loud for some people. Personally I really loved it. Many ""fancy"" places can get a bit uptight which can ruin an experience. The decor is modern and the lighting is perfect. Romantic if your are on a date, but not awkward if you are with friends.

Service was amazing!! ASHLYN was our server... She was attentive, friendly, knowledgable and overall on point. If you visit STK, make your experience that much better by requesting her. 


Food:

Charred Portuguese Octopus: this was INCREDIBLE! I was skeptical about the nectarines, but boy was I wrong. They blended perfectly with the pickled onions, salsa verde and the greens. There are many ways you can go wrong with octopus... This one was perfectly charred and not tough. 

Braised Pork Belly: 

I would and could eat this everyday. The truffle Aioli made all the flavor in the pork belly POP. Shoutout to the unsung heroes here... Fava beans.

Local Brook Trout: 

Delicate and PERFECTLY seasoned. The broccolini was crisp and not overcooked. I didn't love the shrimp and crab bread pudding. It is an interesting concept that doesn't completely come together. 

Lobster Mac and Cheese: I was there were 10 lbs of this in my fridge right now. This was AMAZING. You could come and just eat like five rounds of this and be happy, that's how good it is. 

Grilled NY Strip a la Oscar (with crab meat and sauce on top): this steak was great and the extra crab meat really gave it a nice surf and turf feel. My partner commented that this was one of the best Strips he has ever had. 

Bone In Filet: Cooked medium rare was juicy and perfectly seared. 

Drinks: 

The wine selection was AMAZING... Seriously... It is on the pricier side, but you really won't be disappointed.

I made a reservation to take my wife to celebrate our anniversary.  We got there and the hostess was not very friendly, but maybe it was because we were a few minutes late. In any case, we were seated and ordered some cocktails and an appetizer - shrimp Rice Krispies.  The appetizer came out quickly and they brought some bread at the same time.  The tiger prawns were delicious, but the appetizer brought 2 pieces of shrimp, so each came out to $7.  I am not cheap, but you cant help but feel cheated a bit here.  
My wife ordered the filet with the chimichurri sauce and the Parmesan truffle fries.  I ordered the skirt steak with a red wine sauce and the asparagus.  The food took well over 30 minutes to arrive, which was not a huge problem, but has to be mentioned.  The steaks were fresh and cooked perfectly, but the taste was really bland.  There was no condiment on either steak and even though they were tender and easy to cut through, the lack of flavor was a let down.  The sauces were a necessity to add taste to the food, though the chimichurri was not very good. 
The sides were not much different in that they too disappointed.  The presentation is great, but the fries were just barely sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and the truffle oil could not be tasted, so they were just simply bland potato wedges.  The asparagus was ok but again, lacked seasoning.  As a dessert, we ordered a passion fruit cheesecake which was really more of a mousse than a cheesecake, but delicious none the less.  Overall the appetizer and dessert were the highlight of the evening, but STK fails as a steak house and it does not compare to others in the area.

A $47, 6 ounce filet with little flavor and a modicum of tenderness was only saved after being slathered in a darn good horseradish.  We all know this shouldn't be the remedy for beef if harvested and prepared properly. Even the accompanying asparagus was ineptly prepared. I think anyone with a home economics level of training should know that the raw vegetable should be trimmed of the stringy portion near the base and unfortunately the chef must have missed that day in class.

   We both ordered a hamburger with cheese and ketchup, hush puppies and cajun fries, while he had a strawberry milkshake and I got a Sprite.

   It took some time to get to the window to pay that people in front of us started to drive off, and because of that we had to repeat our order to the cashier once again, letting her know that several cars ahead of us had driven off. I couldn't figure out if it was because the food was going to be awesome and it was packed or because of the service being slow. 
   Anywoo... as far as my food was concerned, I liked the hush puppies. The cajun fries were decent and the burger, the one part of the meal I was looking forward to the most, was just ok.

I was not disappointed as the customization and available options to recreate a healthy falafel pita was satisfied. 

I did a build your own from their Freestyle Falafel, added the sauteed mushroom, pepper and onion, then added romaine lettuce, broccoli tomato, carrot, cucumber and feta with their hummus spread and a little hot sauce. It hit the spot and I will definitely be back.

I asked about a whole wheat pita option and they said their pita is half white, half whole wheat, which works for me.

I agree with Coleen that a marinated tofu option would be nice to have a bona fide protein option for the vegetarians. In general it was nice to find a healthy, quick option for some falafel wraps near Pembroke, because Pembroke itself doesn't have anything like Extreme Pita.

First, we weren't given the corn dog. That could have potentially been the extra star there, who knows right? :)

Overall feelings on what we did get: tasty, average, obviously cooked on a charcoal grill (hence ""Cook out"").. Less greasy than regular fast food.

The slaw dog was fine. Average but good. The slaw was plain, not runny but not overly flavorful. The bun was soft and fresh.  

The onion rings were probably my favorite part. Not greasy or falling apart. Crunchy, but well cooked inside. Savory. 

The hush puppies had potential but they were dry.

I took one bit of the burger and again it was tasty, charcoal grilled. The cheese resembled nacho cheese. The cooked onions on it were okay but I'd have liked them mushier. The bacon was fine.

The milkshake is also very tasty but an hour later I'm still trying to "" drink"" it through the straw. Its very thick.

The whole order was $16 and change. We went at 2:30pm today and it took bout half hour through the drive thru since its still new to the state. 

Milkshake cup notes Psalm 118:24 which says ""The¬†Lord¬†has done it this very day; let us rejoice today and be glad."" 

I am ""glad"" I tried it. I am leaning towards 3 to 3.5 stars because it's just fast food, but I am fairly impressed with the organization of the process given all the traffic. I am sure the crowd will die down in a few weeks and hopefully service stays good. Probably would not go back to this particular location unless I was in the area, because it is far from home.

I've attempted to go to both the L.A. & Vegas locations while traveling but always end up elsewhere. So I was super excited when I found out this restaurant was coming to Atlanta. I would actually give this steakhouse 4.5 stars. 

I went here last night around midnight. What other high end steakhouses in Atlanta are open and still seating at that time?  The restaurant is nice size, not big and not too too small.  The 80's hits do play but I enjoyed the songs and it didn't really bother us. This is definitely a place for the young & trendy. I saw a few folks dancing in an area in front but wouldn't call it quite a dance floor.lol! It is dark inside, but what restaurant isn't these days? The ambience created was nice.

I enjoyed my cowboy ribeye but had ordered the bone-in ribeye.  They were out of the bone-in ribeye  & the chef didn't want to disappoint so they gave me the cowboy ribeye at the price of the bone-in! Now that is excellent customer service! This big juicy steak was pretty good and comparable in taste to many other popular steakhouses in the city. I had the shrimp krispies as an appetizer, mushroom pot pie and the mashed potatoes. All were good, especially the mushroom pot pie! Yum! Yum! My husband had the organic chicken which was banging!

Service was excellent.  Our waiter was attentive and on it. The restrooms were nice, a bit neglected, no tissue in several stalls, trash bin overflowing with paper towels. Maybe they haven't hired anyone to maintain them just yet? Maybe in a few more months of being opened the kinks will be worked out and more attention will be paid to the restrooms.

However, the food is a real let down.  We had ordered oysters and sliders and fries.  The oysters were fine but the sliders and fries were just plain dull.  They most certainly did not taste fresh, which is surprising, since it took them nearly 30 minutes to bring out fries and the place was pretty much empty at the time.

We asked for a manager regarding this policy, and his poor excuse was absolutely crazy. His claim was that if they get really busy it's just too difficult for the kitchen to have separate orders of food entered separately for one table. Are you absolutely kidding me?!? Every other restaurant establishment is able to handle this with no problem whatsoever under any and all circumstances, so STK must be very unskilled and inadequate in operating a restaurant business. We called ahead a month in advance and wanted to reserve a private room, but they required for all the food to be paid for weeks in advance in the minimum amount of $1,000. Obviously we refused. We just opted to have a reserved table. I'm sure we spent at a minimum $2,000, so they should have been very happy to get our business and should have done whatever to accommodate us. Wonderful valet parking, though, only $3. You can't beat that in midtown Atlanta. 

The food was good. The highlight for me was the garlic rolls. Bangin'! This bread was huge! And complimentary!!! Soft as a feather inside. They get 5 stars for this bread, the best bread served at a restaurant besides the croissants at Cheddar's. The other delish dish was the Mac & Cheese. Fantabulous! None of us could stop eating it. Another reason for the 3 stars and a problem that I had was the servers would constantly and immediately yank items off the table without asking if we were finished with it, drinks, food, plates, everything. I mean, they would just literally reach in front of us without uttering a mumbling word and yank all items. I was about to grab for the last huge hunk of bread that was on the table, and the server had just reached in front of me and grabbed it and carted it right off to the trash.

So wanted to like this place, as the vegan options in Boston are still few and far between. But I've tried quite a few menu items now and have been disappointed by how they don't really taste that great.

I will say this: their chia seed pudding and their guac burger are quite good. Pesto meatball sub, surprisingly, tasted very much like the real thing (impressive) but felt a little nutritionally-wanting afterwards. Those are the only things I like there. And the design and decor are fantastic.

I found the shiitake bacon on the kale caesar salad kind of disgusting. The quinoa taco salad started out well but you get tired of the heavy flavoring about 1/3 of the way through the salad and don't want to finish it. Spicy thai salad was meh. Classic burger was okay but for me personally, it had horseradish in the sauce and I can't stand that. I'm a cold brew snob so you might take this with a grain of salt but I didn't really like their cold brew coffee. That giant sugar espresso cookie they have is definitely super-sugary. Almost couldn't finish it. Only ordered for the novelty and left feeling kind of ugh.

And then they fired their founder, Chloe Coscarelli, for not allowing them to open non-vegan locations. Which would kind of defeat the whole point of the brand. I heard that because of the ongoing legal dispute, she wasn't even present at the opening of the Boston location. And now she's fired. Last straw. Not going back.",2017-03-27 23:01:15

Located right next door to a cute brand new Italian dining establishment next called Cucina Asellina, STK is exactly what it claims to be...not your daddy's steakhouse.  If you're going expecting a dimly lit, quiet atmosphere with white table clothes and somewhat pretentious 50-something's, go across the street to The Oceanaire.  This place is meant for 20-40ish year old, Midtown socialites.  Still fine dining, still hoity-toity service, but more of a fun, new-age atmosphere for sure.

So now that you're past that element, the food...simply put AMAZING.  If you respect steak and seafood, you won't find it cooked any better.  I indulged in the 10oz filet with STK Bold sauce (I'd describe it as a lemony, bold habanero pepper taste.  Waiter told me that the pepper taste actually comes from a blend of Sriracha Thai Hot Sauce) topped with lump crab meat.  I also took in a side of Lobster Mac and Cheese cooked in a searing pan.

Something to certainly take from this experience is that they are anticipating you to drink here, which wasn't what my wife and I went to do.  Their mixer cocktails looked fantastic and if you have a group of 4 or more, their wine selection is superb.  However, they do not serve any Sweet Tea products, which is strange in the South.  I finally settled on Lemonade, which tasted house-made and was very good.  The waiter told me they really only have basic fountain drinks outside of bottles water and alcohol drinks.

If you want a salad or healthy options just ask for the grilled chicken, extra extra lettuce, extra extra tomato, pickles and toss one or both of the buns and have at it! Improvise or as my Grandma use to say ""you better learn to make due"" ... literally what do you expect for $5.39 drive out?! It's not Grind house, Farm or Yeah burger and neither are the prices! If price isnt an object then.... ;-) Enjoy! Or not.",2015-01-21 20:37:38

He gave great recommendations my only complaint is that my food which was the braised short rib was only luke warm but the taste was really good so I didn't send it back but next time we spend the type of money we did I expect everything concerning my food to be on point.

Our server was good and gave us helpful suggestions as well as walked us though the menu.  It was obvious that the menu has caused others some consternation in the past regarding  a la carte items.  We had a group of 5: 1 salmon, 2 filets, 1 bone in filet and 1 porterhouse.  A couple of steak tartar appetizers, and rounds of salads were ok.  The menu is over priced.  For the steaks (which should be the signature): 1 Porterhouse was ordered medium-rare and was served medium, very dry, and was a disappointment.  The is not acceptable and darn near tragic for a $50 steak.  The filets were prepared according to the order: medium rare.  The shrimp (served with the filet as a special) and salmon were all very good.  The drink menu was a little light as was the ""by the glass"" wine list (mostly Chardonnay of which I am not a fan). The music was a lot of fun but so loud that the table of 5 was unable to have a conversation.  The location on Peachtree, less than a mile from home for us, is ideal.  The 3 stars are for the service (although not perfect) and the 2 filets. If half stars were available it would be 2.5 stars.  It's challenging for me to take this restaurant seriously after Rathbun's, Alfredo's (no longer open and Italian focused) and Joey D's (OTP even).  I do not understand the 4 and 5 star reviews that have been given and can only assume that others rating STK that high have not been to some of the other gems in Atlanta that excel at beef.

Our server, Alex, whom I originally would have given higher stars has fallen a bit. We realized after the dinner that the special was simply the standard filet with a $10 charge for a small quantity of crab and another $20 for shrimp for a total of $68 for a small filet. Obviously, it's my fault for not specifically asking the price of the dish and I will never make that mistake again. However, I would like to point out that at other fine dining establishments (those mentioned above) the price point would have been given when the special was announced.",2016-05-22 04:14:35

I was as impressed by the service as the food, maybe moreso. 

Cut to a few months later, and the wait has slowed to a crawl. There's still a line of cars wrapped around the building - patient folks, these customers, or maybe just unable to get out of the line once they're in.

BBQ sandwich was small and boring. 

Fries were stale and dry. I understand they air bake their fries so they're not going to be as crunchy as deep fried but these tasted like McDonald's fries after they sat for an hour. 

The soup was actually the best dish we ordered. Pretty sad a soup sitting in a warming pot all day was the best tasting dish.

Didn't try it out there, and decided to look it up when I got back to GA to see if we had one in the area...and we did.  Seeing that it was only one coming up on Yelp, I prepared myself for long lines due to hype.

Drove 16 miles to get fast food (shame on me).  Once I arrived, I couldn't believe the drive-thru lines.  Didn't see one line like that in NC. Decided to go in and see if I could get my food quicker. It didn't take long, about 20 minutes. The interior is small, very hard to eat-in since there isn't many seats.

The burger for me resembles Five Guys. Good flavor, thick enough patty, loved the bacon of course, but I wish they would use real cheese instead of whiz. The hot dog was nothing special. Fries were extra salty, but crunchy.  The highlight was the milkshake.  Wow what a punch of flavor! Peanut Butter Fudge.  Pure yum. I was really surprised how good it tasted.

Will I travel so to stand in line for a good milkshake? Nah.  Too many burger joints in this town to choose from.  This place is all hype.",2014-07-01 13:22:28

After asking to speak to the manager, I was told that he would secure a reservation and our first round of drinks at their sister Italian restaurant next store.  We walked in to a ghost town of an Italian restaurant and were served up two watered down drinks.  Wow, thanks.

We observed several Michael Alig looking 1990's club kids coming in and out of STK.  Not sure if these people were the entertainment or the guests.

Management is not listening and only out to make money. It's time for the restaurant to take charge - read the reviews and listen to your customers. Another bad point, manager on duty does not come around and talk to customers and see if everything is going well -  NO where to be found!

The burger itself was cooked to perfection, it wasn't greasy as places usually make it.  It definitely had that cookout taste and smell to it. A little small considering the 'huge' size but it was half a pound so it made up in weight. The hotdog was an ordinary hotdog except for the fact that it had cheese and actual bacon on it!

People slowly trickled in during the time we were there (about 6:30-8:45 pm) and so it never got super loud.  They played the music a decent level as well so talking with my fellow diners wasn't a problem.  Our waiter did tell us because it is busier on Friday and Saturday, especially later in the night it does get nosier.  So fair warning.

When you go, I *highly* recommend asking to sit in Giovanni's section.  He was fantastic waiter!  He was funny and chatty without being annoying.  When we said we wanted to take our time, he didn't rush us and he made great, honest recommendations.  We loved him so much we made sure to ask when he typically works so we can come back on one of those nights (right now he tends to be Thurs-Sun, fyi).

The food was delicious.  I had the fois gras french toast, which sounds weird but the combinations of the slightly sweet brioche french toast with the richness of the fois gras and the baked apple was perfect!  Not a big french toast fan normally, but if they ever open for brunch I hope this become a menu item.

For dinner I had the fish of the day which was flounder, pan seared over risotto with chanterelle mushrooms.  So good.  The fish was perfectly cooked and the portion size was great too.  My fellow diners had steak with sides of mac & cheese and brocollini.  Both loved theirs too.  Fair warning, the brocollini was great, but super peppery so watch out with the first bite.  For dessert we shared the strawberry cobbler and that was great too.

The food was good, but it was outweighed by the awful hostess and waitstaff. Our large group got there at different times. When I went to check in with the hostess, she kept claiming that I had the number of my party wrong and even after I confirmed our number with her several times, she continued to undermine my ability to do simple arithmetic. 

We were then given a booth that was too small. Our steaks were not prepared at the proper temperature. Service was slow. To add insult to injury, an amount of $324 was posted to my credit card for my meal, when in fact it was only $97. I will likely never return to this restaurant, even though the food, once properly prepared, was quite good. Everyone was incredibly pretentious, which for me is saying a lot, since I am in a field full of pretentious people. I would not recommend this restaurant. If you want a truly good steak and a great experience, go to Rathbun's.

Anyway, I had the whiskey bbq sandwich, fries, mac and cheese, lemonade, and cinnamon roll. The food was okay... The sandwich was meh, the mac and cheese was meh (but the mushrooms did taste like bacon) I personally think it needed more salt, the fries was good especially with that aioli (that I couldn't believe that was vegan), the cinnamon roll was pretty good as well but nothing to write home about, and lastly that lemonade was bomb dot com. I love everything about the lemonade... Heck my mouth watering thinking about it. 

Other than that the restaurant was clean. The decor and the environment in the restaurant was very hip.  The service was A-1 the young lady behind the counter let us try the soup to see if we liked it before buying it. I'll probably will give the restaurant another shot some time in the future.

Extreme Pita is a franchise restaurant that serves delicious pita sandwiches all nicely rolled up in what they call a ""grip-it-and-rip-it"" paper package that makes it really convenient to eat.  Their sandwiches are stuffed with pretty much whatever you want, with choices ranging from Italian meats and cheeses to Mediterranean style food like Chicken Souvlaki and Falafel.

Although this is fast food, it seems to be on the healthier side.  I also appreciate the care that goes into their product.  For example, when I ordered my food, the gentleman who made my food washed his hands at a little sink that they have behind the counter, and put on a fresh pair of gloves.  In most other restaurants I've been to, they either don't change their gloves very often, or they don't use gloves at all.  So needless to say, this means to a lot to me.

If you're a vegetarian, you'll appreciate the fact that they cook their vegetarian dishes on the opposite side of the grill from where they cook their meat dishes.  Another nice touch is that they cook their vegetables in water instead of oil.  Extreme Pita also shows an interest in the environment by having a separate recycling bin just for bottles and cans.  It's little details like these that separate companies that truly care about the world we live in, and the health of their customers from those who only pay lip service, or don't make any effort at all.

Extreme Pita is a clean, sanitary dining establishment where you can go to get delicious, healthy sandwiches for less than $8, served up by a friendly staff.  They definitely earn their five stars.",2009-11-06 06:45:55

This review speaks to the incredible lack of service and respect the bartenders have for their customers. On my first happy hour visit, the bartender informed us of their Belvedere vodka cocktail special and told us to come back anytime for it (awesome!). Obviously, we returned. Each time since, we've ordered several of the specials (in addition to other drinks and apps) and received a full priced bill for them. So, we requested price adjustments. The first time, they apologized and said they must have pressed the wrong button. The second time, they proceeded to argue that I ordered the drink incorrectly (although I ordered it exactly as described). They finally adjusted the bill but it wasn't without some shaming, embarrassment, and disgusted looks.

In addition, the bartenders basically ignored us in the couch area of the bar. We either had to walk up to the bar to place another order or occasionally one would walk by us and we'd grab their attention. Also, during our last (and final visit), we overheard a bartender tell a group near us about the cocktail special, even though they failed to mention it to us at any point during the night. They clearly size up their customers and cherry-pick who they tell about their drink specials. The atmosphere could be amazing but the difficult bartenders, lack of patrons, and typically questionable music makes it utterly unappealing and undeserving of being anything more than a mediocre steakhouse. Not worth your time.",2015-08-23 02:56:52

I mean back-up-Moreland-past-I20-wait-thirty-minutes outrageous.  I wasn't willing to wait that long for fast food, so I decided to come back later.

I've eaten here twice just to be sure, and the burger is outstanding.  I've eaten two of the small burgers with cheese and bacon and it's more than enough to satisfy.  It's amazing that they can get a burger this good out in drive thru time.  

I've had two shakes - chocolate chip mint and oreo cookie.  I wish they had passed on the green food coloring with the mint shake, but it was tasty anyway.  The shakes get two thumbs up, but be warned - they are thick.  I almost had a stroke trying to use a straw.  And they give you a spoon, so use it instead. 

I ordered the fries on my first visit, and I wouldn't order them again.  They are floppy and mushy - not my kind of fry at all.  On my second visit I ordered the hush puppies and OMG - come to mama!  The hush puppies looked like mini corn dogs and were bites of crunchy-corn-mush deliciousness.  

The first time I visited, the drive thru line was still wrapped around the building so I went inside.  I waited less than 10 minutes for my food but the wait was fine.  The inside is crowded and tiny, so I wouldn't eat there unless I absolutely had to, but the vibe is good - everyone is just eating and hanging out.  Most of the tables are picnic style w/ flat benches that can seat 4-6 people.  

The people working the registers inside and the people handling the drive thru are very friendly.  I mention this because I wasn't expecting it. 

If nothing else, go for the burger because it's worth the wait.",2014-06-03 02:49:42

Their motto is ""Not your father's steak house.""  This motto is accurate.  The restaurant looks and feels like the kind of place you would see on an episode of Entourage.  They also play top 40 music and some nights have DJs that play things you would probably hear at the Gold Club.  All of this makes me uncomfortable.  This is not a place I would ever take a client.  But then, I am ""dad"" and this place was not designed for me.

Getting past the atmosphere, the steak was excellent.  Though not disclosed on the menu, all of the bone in steaks are dry aged for 24 days (boneless in steaks are ""wet aged"" a/k/a not really aged).  Because of this, it really pays to get a bone in steak.  I had the 20 oz. bone in ribeye medium rare.  It was cooked and seasoned perfectly and priced reasonably.  Some minor issues with the food: 1) the Bearnaise sauce had too much lemon or vinegar and no shallots or tarragon, (so more of a Hollandaise); and 2) the maple bacon brussel sprouts were too sweet.

Another item to consider
Drive by, smell that? Yo - a burger for dinner!
Four sizes to choose from; I can build my own
Or pick one of they specialties. Minds be blown
Steak or Cheddar Style, or I can go Out West
But their signature style is hard to best
When we in a hurry
Sucka, don't worry
I say ""Cook-Out Style"" for a flavor like curry
They make it all to-order, so I'll wait a couple minutes
For a good piece of Bessie, then go up in it
I smell that smoke waftin' through the air
When I'm in the mood for more than medium-rare
The taste is maximum and that's a law
Char-grilled well-done, son; it ain't raw
""Is it gluten-free? Is there something for vegans?""
Yo, go home to your kale chips and your Sara and Tegan
Carcinogenic?
Man, don't be a cynic
But if you eat too many you might end up in the clinic
Hand-made patties, always fresh and never frozen 
Open wide, son, until the whole thing goes in
Grilled onions or Cajun seasoning upon request
Take a bite and you'll know it's the muthafuckin' best... Straight outta Cook-Out

Easy on the wallet when food's comin'...

Straight outta Cook-Out
They got hot dogs, barbecue, and chicken
And it's all so cheap while other joints be trippin'
That five-dollar tray is what I'm gonna tell you 'bout
Choose a footlong or sandwich, then go all-out
Onion rings, hushpuppies, chicken nuggets, Cajun fries
Yo - A corn dog for a muthafuckin' side!
Pick two, double up, add chili or homemade slaw
Drink Cheerwine or add a dollar for a shake. HUZZAH!
Drive-thru or dine in; they got nine tables 
And a mad friendly staff that's ready, willing and able
3 a.m. they hours be eternal like KLF
So get a burger and a shake after clubbin' mos def
Cook-Out got some of the best fast-food in the nation
Make you scream for more without any hesitation
Five Guys, by comparison, barely fit for consumption
Wendy, the King & Ronald oughta feel deep compunction
H&F? One Eared Stag? Argosy? Bocado? Flip? 
Not bad, but for the price Cook-Out feeds three to six
Farm Burger? Bitch, please. Don't even say it
This burger don't play. If it could talk you would obey it
Beats any burger you gonna find in a diner
With a flavor that was bred and spread in Carolina
So when you want a burger that's like no other
Or a shake so good you'd slap your crippled grandmother

Pretty much all the good things about the food that everyone else has said are true. But the customer service is atrocious.

They try to rush you and make you feel like you're being an inconvenience even when you're not the kind of person who takes forever to order. Last time I went, I was asked ""is that all?"" and before I could even answer she asked me again, as if I was taking too long to reply. It was literally less than two seconds.

First experience was in NYC where they have multiple locations and when I heard about them opening up in Boston, I freaked! Not a fan of their classic burger (which I tried in NYC) but I was very impressed by their guac burger. very rich in flavor. the air baked french fries with their beet ketchup and chipotle aioli are a must try. Oh, and their blueberry lemonade drink is a flipping hit, 10/10. 

The second time I visited I came with a friend and we shared the mac and cheese & avocado pesto pasta. There is a small and large option but honestly, the small is more than enough. Both were amazing! Who knew gluten free could taste this good? Also, the staff are very accommodating. We waited a bit long for our food due to a mix up and they extended their apologies and surprised us with complimentary sweets: a chocolate chip cookie which was to die for and their matcha cupcake.

If you're looking for a good alternative to Chipotle, Extreme Pita offers the same fast casual experience with lots of fresh veggies and a good vessel for them (the pita).  

It's hit or miss on the south shore whether or not someone will know what you're talking about when you ask if they have vegan options, but Emily knew  exactly which items were suitable for vegans, from the pita (which is suitable) to all of the dressings (there's a decent amount that are vegan). 

I got the falafel because, well, falafel is my favorite, but you can't really find it on the south shore that easily. 

It had tons of good veggies, hummus, and the falafel (just had to omit the Sriracha mayo). I added tabouli, so that it wasn't dry without the mayo, and it was really good.

But I was kinda disappointed! When questions were asked we were very rudely answered, like we were putting out the waitstaff. She cut us off and tried to rush us when ordering. When in customer service the key is to be nice and friendly, you want to have people come back. 
 Vegan and vegetarian diet is still up and coming, to be discouraged to ask questions by a rude waitstaff puts the first bitter taste in your mouth.

Now onto the food. We all ordered a different burger and they were all amazing. Very good with flavor and very good portion. We were all full. 
As for the sweet potato fries that are raved about, due to being air baked, were AWFUL. My first experience with an air baked good. Sadly my last. They are not included with your burger, so they cost more. They are hard, and the flavor is just not there! I can do better at home!

Desserts 2 cupcakes and a chocolate chip cookie.
The frosting on both cupcakes hade no flavor, and the cakes themselves were meh.
The cookie was good but super sweet. 
The cookie almost tastes like a frozen cookie.

Let's just say that while the steak was good, there are a couple of drawbacks to STK that will insure I do not return.  Let's start with the atmosphere.  Nice restaurant.  Modern and  tasteful.  Not the sort of ""clubby"" decor one would expect in a steakhouse.  I made an early reservation for two and arrived on time.  Was ushered to a very small table.  Noting we were an ""early"" reservation and that we'd likely be out before the evening rush, I asked if we could perhaps sit at a larger table.  Was told, no, the restaurant was booked and there was no other option.  OK, small table..  Like REALLY small table..  Server arrives and he's actually quite nice although a bit over eager to do his explanation of the menu.  We order drinks which were promptly delivered.  Salad of peaches (it is Georgia and it is peach season) with an excellent mixture of greens and a slightly sweet vinaigrette was nice. Next up steak.  My companion had a very nice strip cooked just as she liked; I had a rib steak that was excellent.  OK, so far so good...  Kinda that is..  All of a sudden the music gets very, very loud..  I mean seriously loud!  It's dance music with a serious bass beat..  Now this is NOT conducive to conversation or the digestion of one's meal I might add.  Apparently this is a signature of STK..  Turning the steakhouse into something akin to a dance club.  So what started as a good meal at albeit a very small table was now ruined.  I could not hear my dinner companion so after a quick desert and the check we departed with ringing ears.  Oh and on the way out the door, at prime dining time, I noted that table that we asked about; the larger one for maybe 4 people occupied to 2 people happily dining away on their evening meal!  That, along with my ringing ears did not sit well.  As for the food, it's actually very good.  Prices are typical high end steakhouse so be prepared.  But what really turned me off was the music and how a simple request for a larger table could not be honored when, clearly, it could.  Good food is only part of a good restaurant.  Ambience and meeting the guest's reasonable requests are also as important.  So, again, great food but be prepared.",2016-08-28 17:22:01

The drinks consist of sugary versions of classic cocktails.  The ""Not your Daddy's Manhattan"" is an insult to its inspiration.  The food was fine.  Nothing great, but nothing terrible either.

The music was an odd mix of 80s hits.  I kept feeling like I was in a college bar or at a sorority formal.  When I think about a nice steakhouse, I don't really picture myself jamming out to ""Come on Eileen.""

It's due to work, mostly; all my corporate HQs reside among their shining, uh, Applebee's and Grills de Macaroni. (Seriously, the last time I was up there, I asked my local co-workers to recommend a place for me to eat. They suggested ""Taco Mac."" I almost collectively punched them all in the throat.)

I typically drive to Charlotte when I go up there. Yeah, the company will spring for airfare, but why bother at that point? With lines and delays and whatnot, it'll take me four hours to fly up to NC. I might as well drive and have my car. I can listen to my podcasts and stop off at my choice of one of two outlets malls on 85. Tis the stuff of which dreams are made.

And this is how I becamse familiar with Cook Out.

At first I thought Cook Out was some ratchet one off burger shack. Little did I know that that first Cook Out I visited was a ratchet burger shack that was part of a much larger whole--a Carolina institution even! ""So I can get a burger and a chicken sandwich, and hush puppies and a hot dog and onion rings and pulled pork and a million different flavors of shakes? You want my order? Wait, didn't I just give it to you?""

So yeah, that was my introduction to Cook Out. It's my secret shame whenever I head up to NC. My wife and my cardiologist both hate that I love it so. ""Hey, where are you right now?""

""Uh, in a strip club. Yeah, a strip club. Getting a lap dance.""

""Dammit, you're at Cook Out again, aren't you?!""

But Cook Out was only for those out of town ocassions, a reward for enduring Arkham-level insanity as 18 wheelers try their damndest to add four more wheels (uh, mine) to the bottom of their rigs. Now, as if Cook Out corporate decided it best to bring the mountain to Mohammed, they open one on Moreland. Good Lord

For better (or worse, according to my wife), it's Cook Out. Same stuff, same expansive menu. Same Carolina-esque option of putting cole slaw on everything. The line is crazy long, for it seems I'm not the only devotee in Atlanta. Still, the staff handles the crowds with aplomb.

I do wish the crab would have been a little more abundant.

I will complain that their sodas are in glass bottles and cost $3 each.  I know I know.....  I'm paying $50 for a steak so a $3 soda shouldn't be a big deal.  I like to have about 4 or 5 diet cokes during the course of my meal so this is a little annoying to me.

Then we share side dishes amongst everyone at the table. 

I'm always pleased with the steak, it's prepared well and it's fresh. Their side dishes are fantastic as well - my favorites are the parmesan fries and mac and cheese. I'm not a fan of the mushroom pot pie, although my friends seemed to enjoy it. A bit too creamy and rich (but not in a good way) for me. They definitely skimp out on the oysters though when you order them. You'll get 4 jumbo ones, then 6 baby ones... 

The atmosphere is right up my alley - trendy, sexy, and classy. A lot of people don't like the DJ playing in the background but I love that kind of thing.

Anyway. Bartenders were obviously over-extended, pretty rude to first timers who didn't know they had to hand them a tip one millisecond after receving our drinks. Ok, I know we're newbies. But we pretty much waited twenty minutes to even hand them a tip to make up for our ignorance. They were moving pretty fast; maybe someone should have been able to shadow them to pick up the tips. Otherwise STK had really positive energy. I enjoyed myself here! It was great! Open bar event (hence the high frequency at the bar), well dressed beautiful women and men, different ages, etc. Good location for those leaving intoxicated.

I have lived in midtown for a year, but just had my first STK experience last night, and it absolutely deserves the three wow's.

Not only does she keep the atmosphere upbeat, and fun with her smile and conversation, but she makes one of the best drinks around. She calls it the Ansley Especiale (a jalepeno & cucumber infused margarita inspiration), and it is absolutely special and should be on the cocktail menu.  The experience didn't end there. I was situated on the bar such that I was fully engaged, and entertained by a host of other fun STK reps. Darrell, Phylicia, Devon, Cody, and Natalie were having a great time, and their enjoyment easily spilled over to everyone around.  A fantastic group of people.  When my vegetable pasta dish (house made pasta!) arrived, other bar customers and wait staff asked what I was having. The look, aroma, and taste were great.

Let me first tell the story of how we got here.

It all started when my wife mentioned to me about one week prior to attending STK that she had some AmazonLocal vouchers for a place named Up Close 2 Jazz Restaurant and Lounge. With that mind, I decided that we would go and we got all dressed up, and decided to hit the place up for a night of dining and music. When we got there, the place was a ghost town, closed and no one in sight. 

Well, being that we were all dressed up and no where else to go, I jumped on OpenTable and created a quick reservation for two (within an hour of that time). It worked, and I had my reservation in hand. Next, we drove up to the restaurant and that's where the special and magical night began.

First, we were greeted with complimentary valet parking that opened doors for us, and treated us like royalty. Next, as we approached the front of the restaurant, a friendly faced door man smiled and opened the door for us, as he commented ""welcome and enjoy your dinner tonight"". Next, we were greeted at the front desk, I gave them my name for our reservation, and they kindly mentioned that our table would be ready within 10 minutes, and they would call us as soon as possible. They also mentioned that we should try their bar (which was up ahead) while we waited. I was still too thrown back at that point, as I looked about and noticed all of the wall decor and the music playing throughout the restaurant. In a few words, this place is hip, trendy, modern, and lively. Everyone was dressed to impress, and that added even more to the ambiance of the place.

I escorted my wife to the lounge area, and set off to get us our first set of wine filled glasses. With no exaggeration, they were back to find us within 10 - 15 minutes of our arrival...and best of all, we were able to bypass everyone that arrived before us, just because we had a reservation.

Our food choices that night included the Tuna Tar Tar for our appetizers and the Filet Medallions for the entrees. Couple that with a nice body of red, and it was an incredible start for the night.

All in all, this place rocks and I'll absolutely be back to try other entrees. And best of all, my wife was impressed with me for even finding this place, let alone taking her here. Win-win situation ;-)",2012-12-17 00:51:50

Ive been to STKs in other cities but never to the one in my home town surprisingly, and I gotta say this is the best one thus far. 

The atmosphere and ambiance were fantastic! The lighting was perfect and I loved how they adjusted it as the evening went on. The music was great! The first hour it sounded like the Beyonce Pandora (definitely not complaining), but when the DJ started spinning everyone was enjoying it. Also, you rarely find restaurants with no ""awkward tables"", but I cant imagine anyone complaining about where to sit in this beautiful space. 

Everything that came to the table was more delicious than the last! The bread was hot fresh and soft, the sides were tasty, and you gotta try the cucumber stiletto. Coming from a guy that exclusively drinks bourbon, this refreshing vodka cocktail is a game changer. I had the short rib and not only is it HUGE, but it practically melts in your mouth (as much as meat can I guess)

Finally, and I rarely say this, the service deserves a special mention. I love waking into a place where the host staff opens the door and greets you with a smile instead of hiding their phones real quick and being like ""oh hey!"" And I gotta give a shout out to our server Ashlyn. This chick is a total sweetheart and provides an exceptional dining experience.

It turn out to be one of the worst experiences we have ever had in a restaurant in our lives. We get there with a reservation for 4, on a Sunday around 7pm, we get seated promptly as there was not a lot of people. We wanted to eat the best steak they had in the house, the server announced that they were out of that steak because they were really busy over the weekend, so we decided to get the second best steak they had instead, it was a ""bone-in rib steak"" and french fries. The server also informed they were out of french fries (really?) so, we said ""whatever, lets just order something else as a side and everything should be alright"", at this point they didn't have the entree or the side we wanted, but no big deal, let's try something else. So, we go ahead and ordered a couple of glasses of wine, when we received them, they both had big chunks of cork floating all over them, we had to wait about 15 minutes to get someone to replace them, the server was nowhere to be found, we finally received two new glasses and the food. I have to admit the steak was pretty good but about half way when eating it we noticed that none of the ""bone-in rib steaks"" had a bone at all,  so we call the server and asked her if we got the right steaks, she confirmed that it was supposed to have a bone, so she went to the the kitchen and came back explaining that we did get the wrong steak because what we order was supposed to have the bone, but she also said she had no idea what we've got. She apologized and offered to take a 10% off the bill. At this point we are so frustrated with our experience, but we tried to let it go and try to enjoy the rest of the evening. After we received the bill, we noticed that they still charged us for the ""bone-in rib steaks"" that we never ate (it was $48 just for the steak, each, without the side), so we ask to speak to a manager. This lady comes to our table with the name of Jessica Shilling (assistant manager) she was very short with us and rushed. Her only explanation or solution for our problem was ""Im very sorry you got the wrong steak, we have been very busy and we probably just ran out of it, here is my card, next time you come i'll make sure it's right"" and she just walked away.  .............sooo.........what was that?????? how is that a response from a manager about we being charged for something we didn't get? so because they didn't have something they will just bring out something else they choose without telling us?.  So, we walked out very, very disappointed of this place, my mother got mad at me for taking her to the worst restaurant in Atlanta. Even a $1 cheese burger from McDonalds would have been replaced or reimbursed if it was done wrong or if you received the one you didn't order. Imaging a restaurant where you get something you didn't order and your tab is still $300 and they don't care or do anything about it. Well that's STK.

The two exceptions to my disappointment would be the tuna appetizer with fruit which pleasantly reminded me of pizza and the drinks which were delicious and unexpected.  I ordered the fois gras and truffle fries and was utterly disappointed in both.  The fois was overcooked and a very small portion considering how large the brioche which accompanied it was.  It also appeared to be the very last piece of the package and should have been discarded or in addition to a fresh piece.  The dish was overly sweet, but honestly, might have been delicious if I had had a good piece of fois.  I also got the fries because everyone raved about them but I think had one before I decided they were not worth eating.  They were the kind of mealy fries you might get in an elementary school lunchroom that had unmelted parmesan on top and were utterly devoid of any hint of truffle.  I don't know if they were old or what, but they were an utter failure.

Since there were three of us at the table, and there were three options for each of the three courses provided, we each picked an alternative item so we got to see and experience all nine that evening. 

We also added a few appetizers that were off the prefix menu in order to experience more for this fantastic facility had to offer. So for the appetizer course we had the fried lobster tail, the truffle fries, the charred octopus, the romaine wedge, and the pork belly. Each was very unique and quite delectable. 

For a main course we had a duck breast with bok choy and a steak with mashed potatoes and a fillet of fish. I he the duck which was a fabulous. My friend enjoyed his steak which was up-sold to include the truffle butter. He really enjoyed it, but felt the portion was a bit small. The fish was served with a bed of crab and lobster bread pudding. I assumed that would be excessively rich and fishy but my dinner mate was very pleased. 

The hand dipped ice cream sandwich was massive and delectable but really too much cookie outside and far too large for one person after such a great meal. Share that one!  Oh and don't forget to have a Ginger Mojito!",2015-09-07 13:36:47

When this place first opened on Moreland, locals were so starved for a new drive-through option that it was practically a traffic hazard.  The restaurant had prepared by hiring a small army of enthusiastic traffic directors, menu-givers, and order-takers with clipboards. Amazingly, it took no longer to navigate the wraparound line of cars at Cook-Out's drive-through than it often did for other fast food spots in this strip to process one or two orders. 

I was as impressed by the service as the food, maybe moreso. 

Cut to a few months later, and the wait has slowed to a crawl. There's still a line of cars wrapped around the building - patient folks, these customers, or maybe just unable to get out of the line once they're in. The eager army of freshly employed traffic directors have disappeared. The last time I waited in that line - and I mean last - service was not quite rude, but just at the borderline, understandable when too few people are tasked with serving too many.",2015-02-11 01:27:50

Overall STK is a trendy place with an overpriced menu for on-par food. After being promptly seated we were offered refreshments right away. Our waitress was helpful and knowledgeable, and was very attentive. 

Appetizer of tuna tartar was very posh, neatly organized on a well-dressed avocado salad and covered in thin-sliced yuca chips. The chips were lightly salted and very crisp, perfect accompaniment for fresh tuna.

The romaine salad left much to be desired, was over-dressed and sloppy. The heirloom tomato salad, however, was a delight, smothered in fresh raspberries with hidden nuggets of zingy goat cheese spread throughout a labyrinth of heirloom cherry tomatoes of varying degrees of acidity. 

On to dinner, which unfortunately did not meet my expectations. After having our waitress describe the 'cowboy double cut' lamb chops as something of sheer glory, I was well expecting something unworldly to be served. Not so. Cooked perfectly, well-seasoned, but somewhat boring. They were butchered flawlessly, beautiful white bones frenched and trimmed, served on cut potatoes with a pomegranate reduction. The meat was tender, flavorful, but had the slightest hint of mutton that sort of ruined it for me. You really expect nice, young lamb at a place with reviews as high as STK, but instead I was served something more akin to summer-slaughtered sheep ribs. 

My dinner date ordered a 10oz filet, not once, but twice due to a bark which was more like a salt crust than actual seasoning. The accompanying b√©arnaise was a delight, tainted with fresh lemon and full of flavor. Unfortunately, you can't enjoy a filet when you're consciously cracking salt crystals between your teeth.

Finally, dessert: fresh, warm, gooey, chocolate cake. Perfection. Too bad the staff in the kitchen couldn't apply the same skill to grilling and seasoning a filet and choosing a better source for lamb.

STK, I rate thee 3 stars, and will probably stick to my usual steak place instead of trying you again.",2012-06-15 18:40:59

Now I've been to plenty chic upscale restaurants and have had to wait a bit past my reservation due to over booking or tables being taken up.

I did not want any of the appetizers as they were not on my palate at the moment.  Also, we did not finish our drinks.  Also, there was a limit sitting at the table for the celebration for less than 2 hours.  OMG!  As a result, we were told to move immediately with our drinks as the birthday girl was leaving as time was up.  Shame! Shame! Shame! 

Next, I decided to ask for the manager who approached us at this tiny table. It was embarrassing!  He apologized, and stated to look more into their policies.  I am not a hell-raiser, but, I stated my displeasure with their service.  Therefore, since my friend still had her one drink, unlike myself, he placed her tab on the house.

I would love it if By Chloe offered reusable glasses and mugs to those customers eating in the restaurant. I was given a plastic cup for my iced tea and a plastic straw. It would really cut down on waste and be better for the environment to offer customers regular glasses. Just a thought!

Other than the location, I'm not sure how they justify the price. The decor/atmosphere isn't that great and neither is the food.

At first I was really upset that this went up in basically the stupidest place possible for a vegan restaurant. The Seaport is a tourist eyesore with no parking and no reason to go there. Parking starts at $15 if you can't snag one of the 8 street parking spots, and the only public transportation is a bus. Now I'm kind of relieved the restaurant itself is such a massive disappointment so I don't have to bother with it. 

The portions are just insulting. For $30 I bought my wife and I a miniature guac burger (doesn't come with a side), a meatball ""sub"" that was basically a couple meatballs sitting on top of a tiny hot dog bun, some undercooked fries, and a lemonade that was pretty good and over with in 3 sips. I could have made the same thing at home, and better, 6 or 7 times over for this amount of money. 

For a forcibly hip yuppie restaurant you'd think they could hire some staff that could manage a ""hello"" or anything beyond just gawking at you.

TL;DR - great steaks but big misses in service, and not a very pleasant atmosphere.

The Good: The steaks (bone-in filet and bone-in ribeye) were delicious. Cooked as requested, nicely seasoned. We ordered a couple of sides that were also very tasty. Our server was fine, except for a disappearing act (more on that later).

The Bad: After careful study of the menu, we placed our order. We also ordered a bottle of wine (not a cheap one, but one of the few under $100). A loaf of bread was delivered and it was devoured. And then we waited. After 10-15 minutes our server let us know that as soon as the bartender got around to it we would get our wine. Another 10-15 minutes passed and, as our steaks were being delivered, we were informed that they could not find the wine we'd asked for, and suggested another option. Really, with our dinner in front of us?? No, we just had 2 glasses. Their loss.

The server asked us to cut into our steaks to be sure they were done correctly. OK, but we don't have steak knives yet. Oops.

My wife picked at her lobster mac and cheese and let us know it was lukewarm, at best. When I caught the server's attention she apologized and put in an order for a replacement. The steaks were nearly gone by the time the new food arrived. Unfortunately it was just standard mac and cheese with a couple of chunks of lobster. Good but nothing special. To be fair, after I expressed surprise that it was still on our bill, the server removed it. 

STK is not what I expected as a steakhouse, and maybe I should have read between the lines in the other reviews. It appears to be more like a club that serves steak. The music is loud and as the evening progressed, the bass got even louder (we could feel it in the seats of our booth). If you want to eat a meal and feel like you're in the back seat of one of those cars that plays music loud enough to rattle the windows of nearby buildings, maybe STK is for you.

My favorite cocktail was the Green Intensity- a little spicy and delicious! If you like steaks, this is definitely the place to order it. However, I decided to go with a lighter option and try the tuna- I was in heaven. The sides are also quite decadent, and the bread at the beginning is just beyond.

Server was wearing gloves but proceeded to hike up her pants from the waistband with both hands. Then without missing a beat proceeded to take our order and make the tacos.  

When I told her that I was sorry but I was not comfortable that she had touched her clothes and was now preparing the food, she displayed an aggressive attitude, threw that plate away, then went to put on new gloves. Thereafter when she took my child's order she gave her one complete Taco and one damaged three fourths of one, clearly taking out her annoyance in a visible fashion. Of course my child noticed that she got a damaged one. 

One expects better of Qdoba which is setting itself up for a national chain. Seems like either they can't teach safe food handling methods to their staff or common courtesy. The better reaction would have been to say ""I'm sorry"" and then calmly make us a new order without the attitude.

I cannot claim to be a connoisseur of fried chicken, but I do know what BAD fried chicken is (ahem, KFC). That being said, Bojangles is not BAD fried chicken. Rather, it's pretty tasty. Not my favorite but it's definitely up there!

This location seems desolate. When we were here for Sunday lunch, there didn't seem to be many customers. We were lured in by Super Bowl specials (some deal on tailgate specials, although I can't remember now) and we were pleasantly surprised. 

The six of us ended up sharing a tailgate special and an extra several pieces of chicken on the side. It was a ridiculous amount of fried chicken. We were a little disappointed when we didn't get our complimentary BoBerry biscuits, but a worker came by later and actually brought us a fresh batch of six sugary hot biscuits. It was a pleasantly delicious win, even though we didn't win the Super Bowl (it's still too soon, isn't it?). 

The fried chicken was hot and fresh, with the perfectly crispy skin on the outside and juicy tender dark meat inside. My one complaint is that the sweet tea is just WAY overboard. I made sure to mix it with unsweet tea to make it more bearable. 

Overall, I can't say I had a bad Bojangles experience. It's not their fault that I prefer Popeyes (sorry, blasphemous statement to many) but that's just how I was raised!!

The food isn't earth shattering folks, it is fast food, but what you get is value, fast service, and one of the largest menu's you can imagine.  Much like in-n-out and Chickfila, these guys don't mess around with letting you know where their corporate values are centered - biblical scripture references on all their bags and cups with a good ole southern God Bless America.  I dig it.  As a NC native, I appreciate some of the offerings from the Old North State - Cheerwine, Cheerwine Floats, and a pork bbq sandwich smothered with Cole Slaw and Texas Pete.

despite the club feel and pretentiousness of the place and some of the clientele, the service was pretty excellent. our server was sweet, almost down-to-earth (in comparison to the rest of the place), completely attentive, gave honest opinions on menu items, and did not at all have her nose pointed in the air. 

and as for the food - it was decent - you come here for the steaks obviously, but we started with the shrimp rice crispies as an appetizer, which was surprisingly full of flavor. shrimp was cooked well, with a nice crispy pan-sear, the rice krispies appeared to be those shrimp chips that you buy at asian markets, just cut up into small pieces. the dish came with a lobster bisque that was poured tableside, which was pretty good - didn't have a particularly pronounced lobster flavor (more of a general seafood/shellfish flavor), but was still delicious and rich.

the bread that was served was also good - it was almost like a cinnamon roll, except savory and with a strange but passable blue cheese smear on top. it was served in a small cast iron pan, which kept it warm. 

as for the steaks - they were good. everyone's steak was cooked perfectly, as ordered (although other reviews on here have noted some inconsistency in how steaks were cooked). they each came with a side sauce of your choice, which was a nice option. i got the bernaise, the others got the chimichurri and the aupoivre. all good, but i thought mine was the best. 

now i've been to steak houses where the steak spoke for itself, and putting anything else on it would have compromised the quality and flavor of the meat. this unfortunately isn't one of those places, as the steak, while seasoned decently enough, definitely needed a sauce to go with it. but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

we had the homemade doughnuts with the bourbon sauce for dessert - which was pretty average, nothing to write home about. it dawned on me after the fact that maybe a trip down the block to the cafe intermezzo would have been a better place for dessert.

all in all, experience was good if you can look past the club-vibe of the place, which itself is a draw for the restaurant, I'm sure. 

when i go to a steakhouse, though, it's to indulge and chow down on red meat, not dress up and try to be pretty. the atmosphere of this place speaks almost against that, because who wants to stuff themselves in their hippest, chic-est clothes? 

judging from the crowd the night we went - apparently, lots of people. 

in my mind, STK is the sort of place where you go to dress-up, show off a bit, have a nice cocktail, and - oh, yeah - maybe eat a little steak if you happen to be craving some (and can afford the extra room for it in your dark wash skinny jeans and fitted button down).",2014-04-29 17:26:50

Someone must have complained because eventually they turned it down one or two notches but then it went back up again. We even asked as we exited the restaurant if they were attached to a club .

They serve a small cast iron skillet with fresh baked dinner rolls topped with their very garlicky Blue Cheese Butter.   My Boyfriend loved it, but I couldn't eat the tops of the rolls as there was way way too much garlic on it for my digestive system to handle.  
We started with the Heirloom Tomato and Burrata salad appetizer which was super. I loved the addition of the flat 'croutons' and the tomatoes tasted very fresh and had that 'organic' flavor where you can actually taste the earth it was grown in. We both had the Filet Mignon, mine with the horesradish 6oz. his the 10 oz. Au Poivre  We shared the grilled asparagus and had the trio of sorbet's for desert. Green Apple, Raspberry & Pear.  I liked the apple sorbet the best. The pear was flavorless.  The meat was prepared perfectly to our liking, and service was good. Dolly was our server. She was very nice, spoke a little fast so trying to understand her over the loud music was a challenge at times. Overall it was a delicious and we will definately dine here and are going to try the one in Los Angeles near our home.

After reading some reviews I'd like to point out I was eating with my parents who are in their 60s and honestly believe we were put in the empty side of the restaurant and refused service. Why? We weren't their target demographic they seem to only want club and bar hoppers who are in their 20s-30s. I guess they wanted us gone to save their vibe.

We complained we could not have a conversation and several talbes around us started to complain. One of the managers, Richard, came to our table and said ""this is the kind of place we are"" and  they woudld not be turning the music down. I informed him we would not be returning. After so many patrons complaints they did turn the music down. Still loud but appropriate for the venu but not crazy loud to where you couldnt speak to the person next to you. The bigger issue was the complete and total I dont care attitude of the manager. 
A second manager Froedrick was a completely different story. He apologized, indicated how much he wanted us to return, bought us round of drinks and was overall a great guy and service recovery professional.
The steaks are what they say they are known for. In my opinion they are cooked very well to your order but generally lacked seasoning and flavor. The Sea Bass however was excellent. I dont think this restaurant has figured out exactly what they want to be, a restaurant or a dance club. They need to figure that our out or be a little more time appropriate with their transition. 8:15 with the dinner crowd is nbot the time to crank the music to dance club levels.

Definitely a trendy spot- cool bar, pretty people and great decor.  Has the NY vibe.  The bar is a nice afterwork spot to meet people and mix and mingle.  

A little on the pricey side, but the quality is well worth it.  I can easily see these prices working in NY, and question if it is overpriced for the Atlanta market.  I guess not because it was packed on a Friday night and it those price points do keep a certain type of clientele coming back for more and other types of clientele for away which is fine.  You'll pay about $15 for a drink.  Strawberry Cobbler is one of my girlie sweetie drink favorites and the Mojito is pretty good too considering I've never been a fan.  The bread with the olive oil dipping sauce is good and fresh and I'm not even suppose to be eating bread as I count carbs.  Go figure.  The drinks are spectacular, well made and not watered down and The steaks (a must) rank among some of the best I've had and are with sides served a la carte.  

I think this is a good date night place with a spouse or significant other or a birthday dinner or celebratory place.  I would not go as a first date.  Yes, your date would be impressed by the decor, food, and the ""he picked a place like this at this price tag so he must really like me"" feel, however it's difficult to have a conversation to get to know anyone because the music get's really loud around 9ish.  It's almost like a club atmosphere around this time.  So for first time daters, go early maybe 6PM and enjoy the romantically lit couples table for two and a great meal.  For everyone else it's nice to sit next to your loved one or spouse, enjoy nice food, look cute and just be happy to be out of the house because you can't hear a dam thing.

DRINKS: I was pleased to see that the drink menu offered fun twists on some classic drinks. (I'm biased as I'm a fan of any drink with muddled fruit, and there were several at STK. I ordered a strawberry mojito and thoroughly enjoyed it.)

FOOD: We had a large party, so we each ordered our main entrees and shared the side dishes, family style.  I ordered the short ribs, and while they were food in taste, I felt there was too much fat for the price of the dish as well as the serving size.  As for side dishes, please do yourself a favor and order the corn, grits, mac n cheese and truffle fries. Yummy.

The hype around this ATL location has been deafening for months so, although my husband and I have been hankering to try it, we stayed away because of the lines and crowds we've been hearing about. Well, the moment finally came, we were driving by and it didn't look too crazy, so in we went.

To summarize...

Menu: a bizarre mix of offerings, ranging from the obvious (their signature burgers) to the seemingly out of place (chicken nuggets, wraps, Mexi-style this, Western-style that. Huh? I thought the concept was to be reminiscent of a Southern-style cook out?)

Service: a handful of young adults who seemed pretty checked out. Whatever system  they are running seems disorganized and random. The number of people taking orders is woefully inadequate for how busy the place is. Ditto the number of tables.

Food: Husband ordered a combo plate: 1/4 pound burger with hush puppies and corn dog. Burger was small, indifferent and featureless, not even on the same taste planet as the glorious Five Guys. Even Zesto's Chubby Decker is far better prepared and tastier. Hush puppies were greasy, flavourless and hard. Unforgiveable given that Cook-Out is a Southern chain. Corn dog was identical to the frozen ones you get at the supermarket ie. small and nasty tasting.

Drinks: I got a Chocolate Cobbler milkshake and my husband got a coke float. Now, to be fair, they were both excellent. Definitely the high point. Perhaps Cook-Out should rebrand as a soda fountain and just do drinks :)

Cost: Shockingly cheap, but we got exactly what we paid for: below average, greasy, dull fast food that does not deserve a single one of the accolades heaped upon it. Cook-Out Atlanta is pure hype - don't believe it!",2014-07-12 21:42:14

There's a great selection of pitas, but I highly suggest the gyro pita with Tsatziki. The only reason I know what that is? Because the girl behind the counter gave my mom and I free samples of it before we placed our order. That's pretty great.

They add lots of fresh veggies and grill everything right in front of you. The biggest size isn't that big at all, just a heads up. I also tried the falafel pita, but it fell a little short.

Desserts: their chocolate chocolate pushpop was the stuff of legend as was their ""Chlotess"" cupcake. Their chocolate chip cookie was merely okay, more sugar and nuts than chocolate chips (I'm a big chocolate eater so if chocolate is the main attraction you gotta own that with me!).

Prices: definitely expensive, more so than the local establishments that serve similar offerings. For a salad and fries it came close to $20, which is kinda nuts. For a treat, it's definitely worth it. I still haven't tried their burgers and I'm dying to.

Honestly if there was a Cook Out in the northeast I probably never would have had Burger or Taco Bell as a kid. Their chicken quesadilla is almost identical to Taco Bell and their double cheeseburger blew Burger King's soggy whopper away. I'll admit, as a kid I loved the whopper but Cook Out makes an actual charcoal flame grilled burger I could taste. 

The pricing is relevant to fast food chains, probably a bit cheaper than most. The tray combo is an amazing deal. Choice of a main item, 2 sides or double up first item, and a huge drink for around $5. I got the double cheeseburger, chicken quesadilla, and hush puppies with a huge sweet tea.

The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice and upscale. The DJ played great music and the crowd was sexy. Atlantans take every opportunity we get to dress up and look fly.

After the cocktails and appetizers marketing event, we sat down for a regular dinner. Upon being seated, my partner realized that they were no longer really hungry after appetizers, so we decided to share one entree. We ordered the short rib and a side of their corn pudding and lobster macaroni and cheese. The regular macaroni and cheese costs $8, but for a few tiny pieces of lobster the price graduates to an astounding $23. The price would not have bothered me if they had not been so stingy with the lobster.

All of the food was very good, but nothing that can't be duplicated at another high end steakhouse in town.

Been eager to try out this place and am not a vegan 

Hostess cupcake - pretty good. The cake is a little different from the original but honestly you may not notice the difference at all.

Raspberry tiramisu cupcake- not as good as the hostess one. The cake was a little grainy but still good. The frosting is light. 

Chocolate chip cookie - also very good. The dough is a little more crumbly. But was still moist after 1 day. 

Banana chocolate bread - has nuts. It was very good and definitely couldn't taste the difference at all. 

Overall I was very impressed by the flavor and texture of these items. As a person who doesn't love the overly sweet treats and find there is an overfill of frosting and sugar, this may become my go to place. Looking forward in trying out their other food",2017-06-02 03:14:33

Tony seated us and was nice. He knew we had an interest in the NFL game so he filled our waters and provided updates to the game. But the main reason dinner was so fantastic was because of the service we received from Ashlyn. She was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. She really made our birthday celebration special with a shot from the bar manager and a birthday dessert with a sparkler (that was quite amazing). The food was also fantastic and Ashlyn had great recommendations from the drinks down to the steak sauce. I would highly recommend dining here - it sounds like they have lots of fun specials on Monday and the weekends are a very upbeat and fun atmosphere.

Both filets were cooked perfectly, but personal preference would be the bone in. The sides were amazing as well. The grits were creamy and had a kick, but weren't overpowering with ""heat"". 
It's a very trendy atmosphere with modern music playing in the background. I went early, so the music was at a good level. I could still talk without yelling. The only negative was the seating. All the tables are semi-circle booths which is fine, but the two person booths are a little small. My boyfriend is 6'3"" and I'm 5'9""(6ft with heels), so we're obviously fairly tall people.

When I was greeted, it was with an attitude, as if I was being a bother for making a reservation and being on time.   Unacceptable.   Then I was seated at a table that was too small for two men.  I was not on a date so the table was too small and that should have been recognized by the staff.  An adjustment should have been made for a larger table.  Then, the waiter, by the name of Britt, was not nice.  It was as if he was doing us a favor by being our server.  No eye contact, no explanation of menu items and overall jerk. He was one of the most unfriendly people I have had to deal with in the service industry.  Again, this entire experience, so far was a major disappointment.   Then the food came.

It was lunch time, and this stall in the food court had a pretty good line up, compared to the other places around here, so it is either, that this place is a deal, or it is ok to eat, might as well give it a try. They make your taco's to order, kinda like subway, you get in line, they ask you what you want, and they load it up, and you pay at the end of the conveyor belt.

STK is at the heart of midtown right across the street from food truck Thursdays. First thought walking in was 'holy moly it's empty.' At 7:30pm on a Friday night, I expected more people to be out partying. It might have to do with the fact that it was Friday after thanksgiving but whatever it is -- i was worried. Like most nice restaurants, they had me waiting for the rest of my party before seating us. Which was not a big deal, but for some reason, I was not fond of the hostesses. I felt like i was being blatantly checked out and judged rather than greeted. I did not get single smile or direction to where the waiting area was. talk about awkward.

FOOD:
CHEESY BREAD / complimentary
The bread was a great addition to the starter. I love the little touch of hot cheese on the top and the herb-y dipping sauce was ah-mazing!

TUNA TARTAR $15
It was good, and i thought the taro chips were a clever substitution for tortilla chips. But to be honest, it did not blow my mind like i expected. I think the problem for me was the sauce. I think a more citrus-y sauce would have complimented the tuna better.  Kudos to the quality of tuna. It was soo fresh and yummy, i wish i got in a sashimi or carpaccio form.

HEARTS OF ROMAIN $11
My friends had it and i don't think they were happy about it. Main comments were about the dressing. It was supposed to be Parmesan LEMON dressing not Parmesan dressing.

TROUT W/ MUSHROOMS & GNOCCHI $22?
It was a seasonal item and i definitely liked it a lot. The trout filet was cooked perfectly and the wild mushrooms, gnocchi and bed of broth/au jus was the perfect compliment to the dish. I wish wished that the fish was seasoned a little more.

SALMON SPECIAL $20?
Don't remember much of it but from the looks of the dish, i did not like it. It sounded a lot better than it looked.

WARM FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE $8
The best dish of the night! It was soft, warm, moist, chocolatey but not overly sweet. I'm salivating just thinking about it.

WARM APPLE TART $8
The tart had a great crust but the taste was weird. Definitely a no go.


We also had bottle of wine which was around $50~60. It was very delish. Overall, our tab came out to be about ~65 per person. It was not cheap! I would say my experience was a bit over priced. Next time I'm definitely going for the steak.

The steak was cooked to perfection and had amazing flavors. The lobster mac and cheese was such a great blend and the potatoes were whipped and flavorful. Aside from this, I had a tasty Mai Tai  and a strawberry puree martini with a graham cracker rim. Both were AMAZING!!!

To order, you go up to the register and order and then take it to your seat when they call your name. For vegan food, it was an okay price (kind of pricey) and okay serving sizes, depending on the food item. 

We ordered the Whiskey BBQ burger, the Guac burger, and Pesto Meatball sandwich, as well as fries and their Mac & Cheese. The food was so flavorful! 

The meatballs on the Pesto Meatball had good consistency, and the marinara was great. My friend tasted the marinara more than the pesto. 

They were very generous with the Guac on the Guac burger. My friend thought it was a tad bit overwhelming. 

My Whiskey BBQ paired really well with my Mac & Cheese! I enjoyed the smokey flavors. 

The burgers and sandwich were very hearty and filling, but a little messy. Probably due to the buns. They are pretty thin and flimsy. 

The Mac & Cheese has a little kick to it! Very creamy and the mushroom bacon on top was everything! 

The fries weren't anything too crazy. Got stale pretty quickly, but they are air fried.

The manager insisted they were cooked correctly but that he would send then back if needed. I was not impressed with this reaction. I've dined at many steak restaurants and never seen this happen. Usually as steaks arrive at a higher end steak house you are asked to cut your steak and check for doneness to your request or at least checked on promptly. If not cooked right a manager is at least apologetic and quick to resolve the issue. The lack of resposibity this manager took insisting we didn't know how a steak should look was irritating. We had to send mine back twice. Not to mention I had the king crab steak topper that by this 3rd time back was like plastic.  My husband gave up and ate his.

The staff is really nice. The person who took our order offered my daughter a cookie, which was sweet. They did get my order slightly wrong, and my husband's later, but they are really nice.

We ordered air baked fries, fancy fries, the morning glory (a breakfast sandwich with scrambled tofu & vegan sausage), the classic burger, a small mac n cheese, and two baked goods: a cinnamon roll and a coffee cake.

Overall, the baked goods are great. The cookies are incredible, but only if you are plant-based or a low-oil baker. The cinnamon roll has a beautiful, almost sourdoughish fermented taste to the dough, underneath the sweet glaze, and the and result is fantastic. And the coffee cake is less spectacular but a good, solid coffee cake and a great vegan one. So for breakfast pastries, big yes for me. Later we tried a cupcake, and it wasn't as great as the other baked goods. Okay, but a little oily for me, not very sturdy - eager to crumble and split coming out of the box packaging, and one-note compared to the other baked goods we had.

The savory options are less great, I hate to say. The plain fries, though baked, come off as both limp and oily. The beet ketchup missed the mark for me. I didn't like the earthy sweetness it had. The chipotle aioli is better, but again, very oily - especially for a place that advertises itself as plant-based. The fancy fries are almost like a chili cheese fries. They need to be eaten with a fork and are good, spicy, but oily. The morning glory sandwich I really couldn't eat. Ugh, I hate being so hard on a vegan eatery. But the scrambled tofu does not taste scrambled - or even cooked - to me. They used silken tofu, presumably for an egg-like texture, but the resulting mixture is soggy, cold and bland. Maybe it would make sense as an egg salad substitute, but I think it is misleading being billed as a scramble. The ""sausage"" is a loosely textured burger patty - really nothing sausage-y about it to me. It wasn't spicy, meaty, etc - just like a mushroom burger, and one without sufficient binding agents. There is a thick slice of avocado between the ""scrambled"" tofu and the ""sausage"" that gets lost in  the sandwich. The potato bun did not hold up well with such a wet filling, and got soggy fast.

The classic burger patty is too soft. It tastes good but again the binding agents were wrong. The potato bun performed better here, but the beet ketchup was weirdly sweet and overalls the burger lacked ""classic"" fixings: mustard, onion, pickles, tomato. 

The mac n cheese starts out nicely: smoky, salty & a bit sweet. Once you work your way through the top later of shiitake bacon, almond (?) parm & sprinkled smoked paprika, it becomes a bit bland and sweet for me. My guess is that she is capitalizing on the sweet potato/butternut squash vegan mac trend; I think the recipe needs work. Pasta was a bit overdone, too, but I'll give a pass for that as it's a fast food joint.

I was annoyed (can you tell?) about the ""plant-based!"" marketing, because while vegan, this food is *not* low/no sugar, oil, or salt, which are all considered highly processed foods and strictly limited or omitted in a true plant-based diet. Chloe, as a graduate of T. Colin Campbell's Plant-Based Nutrition certificate program, knows better than to bill any vegan food as plant based.

Chloe is a great pastry chef. I own two of her cookbooks; it's not like I'm not a fan. I think the restaurant concept may have been rushed in what I'm sure is a busy schedule. Or perhaps she expanded too quickly. In any case, I'm still in the market for truly good, truly healthy, quick vegan food in Boston.",2017-03-11 18:35:53

Having spent several years living a stone's throw away from several Cook-Out locations in North Carolina and never being particularly impressed, I couldn't believe all the hype from so many Atlantans when word spread that a Cook-Out was coming our way.

For the uninitiated, Cook-Out is greasy, gut-busting fast food. You can get a side of corndogs or chicken nuggets instead of (or in addition to) fries. You'll wait in an inordinately long line for food that is pretty mediocre. You'll watch employees who are blatantly bored that they have to deal with you.

In my case, we waited for at least half an hour in the wrap-around-around-around drive-thru for two milkshakes. The shakes were delicious, no doubt, but decidedly not worth the excessive wait or being virtually ignored by staff. There was only one lady who we saw hustling, and I hope that she gets a raise. 

Cook-Out is not mecca. Don't drive 15+ miles to come here. But if you're hungry, but not TOO hungry for a long wait, it might be a good spot for you.

So by all means, go check out Cook-Out. Eat some sub-par fast food. Drink a milkshake. Watch parents ream out their kids in the parking lot because they sneaked a fry.

Im so happy to finally see a burrito that is served with red sauce and melted cheese on top and still is tasty.  Still though it doesn't compare to what you can get in other states, but it is way above much else in town and this is just a taco bell. 

   You can get this same burrito at ANY taco bell now. The enchirido was eliminated and this was brought in after as a semi replacement. Its larger though, and more expensive of course. 

  One odd thing here was I was the only one in the restaurant. I didn't realize it was in a bag. The gal just sat it there quietly and let me stand around. I found that odd. I was at the next nearest taco bell today and the gal who makes them again I realized couldn't speak any English.  So maybe that was it, they can be quite shy.

We drove 15 minutes to this DQ for it. This Dairy Queen looks like it was built when the area was not nearly as busy as it is now. There's no indoor seating, it's a walk-up window with a few tables outside. The parking lot is pretty small and the drive thru lane can only accommodate a couple of cars from the road.  We noticed this as we sat outside, watching a woman on Division with her left blinker on to get into the drive thru lane for - NOT exaggerating - ten minutes. Like, she could have parked, walked up, and eaten in that time. We watched her blinking as we savored our blizzards, and then walked to our car and saw her parked, car on, still waiting for her food.

I sat with a friend at one of the tables while we waited for our food. On the morning of 4/3, I noticed my wallet was missing from my bag. The only place I had used it the day before was By Chloe, so I searched for their phone number to call them. By Chloe does not publish phone numbers for any of their locations, so I desperately tried to get in touch with them via email and Facebook. After waiting a couple of hours, someone on their corporate social media team responded to my Facebook inquiry and said she passed along my email to the local manager who would be in touch ASAP. They never offered to provide the store's contact information so I could reach out myself.  After over an hour went by, I reached back out asking if the manager could please get in touch soon before I have to drive the half hour back down there. No one responds, so I start driving down there - keep in mind, I have no wallet/license/credit cards/cash to pay to park. While my coworker waits in my car, I double park and run in for the staff and manager to tell me they don't have my wallet. I briefly look around the table I sat at, but no luck finding it. I get back to my office to find that the social media time passed my inquiry along again and the manager had just emailed me to say they didn't have it. So, I begin cancelling all my cards.

The next day on 4/4, I receive another email from the manager saying they had found my wallet behind a banquette. This makes me wonder, ""did they just not sweep up the night of 4/2 and that's why they didn't see it""? Even if that is the best case scenario, it seems odd. Later in the evening, I drive in rush hour traffic another 45 minutes to By Chloe to pick up my wallet. The manager even asks how I get down there without my wallet, knowing I was missing my license and any form of payment to park. I then receive my wallet to notice that all my cash and even my change purse had been emptied out! When I mention this to the manager on top of my story about not being able to contact them directly, his response was that he was sorry, but he wasn't working the past couple of days to understand the story, but at least I didn't have to cancel my cards now (It had been 48 hours, of course I already cancelled my cards). While I understand that this particular manager might not have been part of the weekend team, the communication breakdown of their management team is bothersome. It seems rather odd to me that their staff found the wallet, held it for me, and then my money was missing... it would have made sense for the manager on duty when it was found to have looked inside and noted at that time if there was or was not money to help remove any doubt that it was the staff who took it, or another person not related to By Chole. It's just too much of a coincidence in my mind, but you can make your own assumptions. 

My recommendation to By Chloe in these situations: 1.) Provide a contact number for customers to call you as opposed to driving to your location numerous time, this could even be something that corporate does on their side. While in this case we are talking about a wallet, I can't help to wonder, what if this was a lifesaving medicine, or an epi-pen that was accidentally left. 2.) Show some empathy and understanding of someone who has now driven to your location numerous times because you don't have a phone number. Throwing someone a free cookie wouldn't hurt your bottom line, especially given these circumstances... it's just bad customer service & company policies that make me never to eat at this establishment again.",2017-04-05 12:55:31

It is the only upscale restaurant I've been to that has a DJ blasting music when you are trying to eat.  It makes having a conversation challenging.  Clearly they are going for a club vibe, but that's not what I want when I'm eating steak.  Speaking of steak, their food is so-so.  It is priced like a good steak place, but the food isn't as good as a real steakhouse.  

The real problem came when I got our check and noticed that there was an extra appetizer on it.  I pointed that out to our waiter, who didn't  apologize, but took it off.  Then taking a second look at the check, I saw an extra drink on it.  At this point, it certainly seemed like they were intentionally adding items hoping we wouldn't catch it.  I asked for a manager, and she claimed this wasn't that case, but rather our waiter was new and had made a mistake.  She wasn't very convincing.

Then the shake menu- GAH! AMAZING! They use actual slices of Philadelphia Cheesecake in the shakes! And they will pretty much make any shake you request if they have the ingredients, just ask!

And, guess what, they have CHEERWINE! At least they did when I worked there! The lines are long sometimes bc they are epic, but the crew is always super fast and the food is worth it! Enjoy!",2016-03-01 22:12:44

As a vegan, I appreciate the staff's thorough ingredient knowledge and willingness to double check (for example, to be sure there were no animal products in the vinegar-based salad dressing). Everything is so fresh and crispy in their salads and wraps...you can actually know what's in there and walk away afterwards feeling like you had a very healthful lunch or dinner.

The last time I went, I got one of the flatbread pizzas--in my case, a hot pita with sauce and vegetables. They didn't blink when I asked for no cheese, double checked that the pizza sauce was OK for my purposes, and proceeded to pile it with the toppings I requested--fresh tomatoes, spinach, black olives, and...perhaps artichoke? Or maybe eggplant. Can't recall what they had, but that is my approximate usual pizza. Then they send it through one of those conveyor-belt-type ovens to cook. It came out great.

One other nice detail for veg people like me--they have a sign on the wall indicating their practice of cooking meat on one side of the grill, and veg items on the other. I've never seen that before, and it gives me a good feeling that keeps me returning (well, that and the numerous great options for veg patrons!).

The menu is fabulous. We started with the tuna tartare and bacon appetizers. And don't get me started on the bread. The fresh baked bread with chive oil was ridiculous. Totally worth the price of admission right there.

We both ordered the bone in filet mignon and they were cooked perfectly. One of us had rare the other had medium rare. And they were huge -- they looked bigger than 14 ounces. My girlfriend added the crab to her fillet and said it was delicious.

We went to bit wild on the side dishes. We tried the mashed potatoes, tater tots, macaroni and cheese, lobster mashed potatoes, and the brussels sprouts.

Well, the first comment (rather second) I'll make is with regard to the amazing service that's provided. It totally reminds me of In'n Out where you have people standing outside and getting your order ahead of time and the line of cars wraps around the entire restaurant... There are also individuals standing around inside to clean up your tables after you. And trust me! It's necessary since they stay packed! They're very quick and I have no idea why ... And if it's just that they're excellent workers but it seems like they enjoy working there. My LO (LO = little one, for those that aren't parents) had an accident there. Wait, do I wanna share this?!? Well, we potty trained him and ..... 

I'll stop there. Needless to say, they were quick to get behind and support me and clean up and disinfect and sanitize ... (You fill in the blank!). Yes, I was embarrassed! And I never wanna be THAT parent. I digress.

This place has:
4 booths
2 tables with bench
3 tables for two

The food is cheap as I mentioned earlier. It's fine. Nothing amazing but fine. I would go back again but I don't wanna get you too hyped! They are a pretty good restaurant with good service (maybe because they're still new?) and decent food.

I was never handed a receipt. It was just taped to a box at bottom of bag so of course i didnt know she overcharged me til I got home. So I tried to call them several times and no one answered EVER! Then I tried to call corporate and left a voicemail and wrote an email on site so hopefully the fix the situation. I hope it was an accident but its real easy for fastfood employees to do these dishonest things its happened to me in the past and nothing against the food or the restaurant itself but they need to have an honest upstanding staff and someone who is qualified to read the totals off the computer and give back correct change.,2015-02-15 06:37:54

I had the Cobia which was awesome! This dish comes with flavors on the plate that compliment this tender flaky fish including olive oil smashed potatoes, spicy lobster bisque, and herb salad.  The pull apart bread that they bring out to start is good.  Imagine a basic dinner roll but heavier, clumped together (for pulling apart) in a small black skillet, and drizzle it with a little bit of butter and blue cheese.  There wasn't much spectacular about the mini ice cream cone dessert other than the 3 cute little sugar cones that the Sprinkled Vanilla, Rocky Road, and Cookies & Cream mini-ice cream scoops come in, but the ice cream and the cones taste really fresh.  I finished my meal with The Prowler cocktail.  That was a full-flavored spirit with a lively lemon flavor.  I think they call it the Prowler because it tastes innocent enough but if you don't pace yourself it WILL creep up on you.  

Expect to pay that midtown restaurant premium, but when it comes to service and quality STK has never disappointed me yet.  This particular Monday night was a tad bit better than usual because the DJ was spinning Prince for most of the evening.

Also, be aware that you can park in the garage behind STK and the STK parking validation covers the cost of parking for up to 2 hours.  After that, you're on your own for the balance.",2016-05-03 04:43:36

As far as the price goes, it's well within most people's budget and competes well with most combo meal prices in the immediate area. The beef tastes like beef for a change and will satisfy you without making feel like a bloated ball of grease. 

The milk shake is great, it tastes vaguely similar to a Bruster's shake, which is fine by me.

Last tidbit is the wait time, don't let the line intimidate you, Cook-Out runs a tight ship and moves the line around the building very efficiently. It's doubtful you'll be in line longer than 15 minutes, assuming that you're a patient customer.

The most recent one:  Ordered 2 plates, no big deal, right?  I got the broccoli chicken combo, which had a good amount of rice...and maybe 4 broccoli florets?  Along with 6 pieces of thinly sliced chicken?  Had enough sauce for triple that amount, at least.  The lady-friend-person that I'm acquainted with for the long haul got a lo-mein and rice combo.  It didn't come with lo-mein, and the appetizers also weren't abundant.  Seems like they've been making these mistakes for a good while now.

The adult menu is OK, with a smallish taco salad (in the optional-but-free edible shell) being my favorite; I get the grilled chicken topping, a bit of guac, the spicy salsa on the side, and it's a pretty filling meal.  I will say, the edible shell is not as crisp and delectable as I've had in other places, but it's OK; probably better not to eat the whole thing anyway, from a calorie and nutrition point of view.

The children's menu is very good, inexpensive considering it comes with a small nachos or burrito or taco (large enough to fill'em up, not large enough to bloat them) as well as the included drink and dessert (we specify a milk and an apple sauce).

Service is fast and very pleasant and the people on the line and at the register are just really nice.  They are friendly to the kids.  When people seem to be enjoying their jobs, we enjoy eating there more.

I usually try to grab a bite to eat beforehand and the choices are, I think, somewhat limited in that neighborhood. Especially if you want something other than gussied up pub grub or standard fare from those fast food joints that are typically relegated to ""the hood.""

I heard Cook-Out was a new player in the area and had rolled into town with a solid rep that they had built in college towns throughout the Carolinas. I heard the offerings here were mostly barbecue and burgers; however, they do feature unusual side items like quesadillas, hush puppies, corn dogs and funnel cakes. I also heard the milkshakes were top notch.

I was a little overwhelmed when I stopped by and saw the parking lot teeming with cars and people. This was no joke (drive thru and dining area crowded with hungry people waiting for their food). The menu was mind boggling and dense with information so I listened to what others were ordering and I ended up getting a barbecue pork plate. I was going to get a to-go plate but I ended up dining in.

For less than 7 bucks you get decent sized portion of good quality barbecue pulled pork, 3 sides (hush puppies, fries, and cole slaw) as well a medium cheerwine soda. the cashier  asked if I wanted a (sandwich) bun (I said yes) but later saw it had been left out / forgotten for some reason; no big deal as I had enough carbs in my meal as it was. 

The pulled pork was seasoned with a vinegar / mustard sauce and Texas Pete hot sauce ; it was of decent quality and was tasty (albeit Carolina style cue). The fries were good too and served piping hot (but a bit on the limp side). The slaw was okay but nothing great. The hush puppies were piping hot and decidedly tasty in an ""old school"" good kind of way. 

I liked what I got overall and the price was certainly right on point. I am psyched for a return visit in which I will try a burger and different side items. Despite the long lines and constant stream of customers , the staff kept things running quickly and smoothly. I am a fan and will be back.

UPDATE: I have tried the burgers and I have mixed feelings about them. They are good but perhaps not great. Opt for ""huge"" intend of ""small"", ""double "" or ""single"".  The taste and quality seems to be better with ""huge"" (in addition to the larger portioning). I have also tried the onion rings and corn dogs and those are also in the category of ""good but perhaps not great.""

Burger orders seem to be cooked / prepared / assembled / processed very quickly (and much faster than barbecue) so if you are pressed for time a burger order might be a better option.

Condiments / utensils / napkins are dispensed with your food order (rather than having them available in the dining room for you to grab yourself); I have mixed feelings about that aspect of the place. They seem to be stingy with condiments (both on burgers and as side servings)

It is very interesting to see all the socio-economic strata / population diversity of the area coming together to dine in the same small cramped interior space

Despite some negative reviews online, I decided to go there. I experience was just terrible.

Positives: 
The decor was very nice! 
Steak was delicious- I thoroughly enjoyed it!

Negatives:
The music was loud, it was hard to talk at a normal pitch. It would've been better if the noise level was moderate.
The 2 person couch seating is terrible. I had to sit through the entire dinner very uncomfortably.

The service was very slow- We weren't served bread unless we asked him a couple of times. Well, I understand that the main course takes time (and it did, and I cannot complain about it because the steak was good). But, we had to wait for 25 mins to get our dessert, and another 15-20 mins after we got our dessert to get our tea. When we ordered the tea we specifically told him to get it along with the dessert. During this wait I had to ask the server on the status of the tea 2 or 3 times. Only after all the wait, he prepared the tea (we were able to see him prepare as the tea equipment was right opposite to our table). The tiny scoop of ice cream on the apple crumb cake melted by the time the tea was served. BUMMER!
Taste: Although, the steak was top class, chicken sucked big time. The chicken was just okay. I'd say it was below par. Definitely not worth it. I also felt the chicken was a little under cooked. The dessert tasked OK. It wasn't great.

Bottom line:
Would I recommend this place for anyone? NO

Nonetheless, you'll find this By Chloe to be much like its counterparts in NY and LA. In some ways, this is great. You get the same consistent food choices you've come to expect elsewhere, delicious items like: kale Caesar salad, quinoa taco salad, guac burger, and matcha blueberry muffins. However, I do wish the menu would rotate a little. If you come too often (easy to do!), you might find yourself getting a little bored of your options. 

But rest assured, give it a week off or so and your craving for their pastries and savory bites will come back strong. 

Side note for all the vegans: yes, it's really unfortunate that Chloe was ousted and I do feel conflicted supporting a vegan business that doesn't have the best intentions behind it. But if it stays all vegan, and attracts, introduces, and converts others to more plant-based options, I still think it's a win.

The manager was called, mind you he himself was wearing jeans and stated it was all over their website about the dress code. When my sister asked him to show her (because she hadn't seen it on the site) he said he didn't know where it was (even though he just said ""it was all over the site"").

First of all, the service (or lack there of) was sub par. The counter personnel was unfriendly and inpatient. I received a text that our food was ready, but it was not. Then, the food came out separately, sandwiches and salads first,  five minutes before the fries finally arrived.

Second, the food was simply underwhelming. The classic burger was extremely bland, the sweet potato fries were extremely soggy and the regular fries were just that and not much more. One of us was smart and ordered safe - a Spicy Thai Salad - which was tasteful.

Last, there is the cost of this lunch, which was even steeper than the cost of the garage parking around the corner. Even after removing the ridiculously overpriced glasses of wine, $7.5O for what could have been no more than 2.5 fl.ozs., our tab was still $95.

parking is only like 3 bucks to valet which is pretty good for that area in Atlanta.

the restaurant was pretty nicely decorated, especially the bar area that you have to walk through to get into the dining room.

the service was ok, i've read other reviews where people have had great service.. we didn't have to wait a long time or anything but we didn't feel like they were that attentive to us, the waiter only talked to my side of the table and we had to relay everything to the other four people.

i would expect more for a place as pricey as this one.  it can get very expensive once you start ordering appertizers and drinks before you even order and entree.

the food:
the food was very good, everything we had no one had any problems with it.

the drinks:
nothing too special.

desserts:
the ones we tried were pretty good, the warm cookie and flourless cake.  there was a dessert people were getting with cotton candy that wasn't on the menu.

if its your birthday or a special event they will bring a round of shots for the table.

so be careful, that on large parties they add the gratuity which is fine.. but they don't tell you and bring the receipt for you to sign and a space to add gratuity.  i HATE when establishments do that.  you shouldn't try to double ding anyone for a tip.

Nothing fantastic but not bad either. I would say 3 stars for the food and the seating area is small if you don't want just take-out. I got the regular size club pita. Comes with turkey, ham, bacon, cheddar cheese, peppers, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, cucumber and mayo. Personally, I think it has to many ingredients to enjoy all the tastes of each one but you can ask them to leave out some. Also, the cucumber didn't quite work for me in a pita. Just gave it a weird flavor. If I was to reorder it I definitely would have left that out. I also got the soup. I think it was called ravioli pumpkin. It was just ok too. The container it came in had a lid with a great seal so there was no spillage for the car ride home. 

Everything has the calorie count next to it on the menu which I love. One of the main reasons I went. But I couldn't find any for the soup. They gave you a range of what the calories were for the soups but that doesn't help. 

Also, they use water in their grill instead of oil. Love that!  

Might be a little pricey but you do seem to have to pay a little extra when getting fresh healthy ingredients.

Honestly, the visual still grosses me out, but the taste of the beet catsup is pretty damn good. It tastes like catsup made from beets. Yum. 

I'm glad I got over it. 

Moving on, my wife and I were in the Seaport recently for a conference and we ate there three days in a row. On the first day we ate there we were with a large group of omnivores and everyone loved their food. In a major way. 

I loved the meatball sub so much I ate it two days in a row. The one thing that was disappointing was that I had to eat this sandwich with a fork as the roll cannot support it's contents. It might sound like a quibble, but this does take away from the experience of eating a sub. But it was tasty. so...

The fries were kind of soggy weird... and almost really good. Made even better with the chipotle aoli. 

I wasn't a big fan of the artichoke kale dip ... it was kind of a weird gluey onion dip. Good in it's own way, but not artichoke dip as I know and love it. The chips were perfectly salty and tasty though. 

On day three I had the nicoise salad. It was pretty good. I liked Chloe's version of chickpea salad well enough and the veggies were fresh, but the yellow dressing was more pointlessly oily than I would have liked. 

My wife loved her quinoa taco bowl, and is still completely raving about the avocado pesto pasta. 

We didn't try desert, but we wanted to. We were just too full. Although the portions aren't huge, they more than do the trick. The truth is, my mouth always wants to eat more than my body needs to. 

I can't really speak for the service as we ordered ahead and just picked up our order at the counter. But the place was cute and clean.

My wife and I were the first to arrive and had a drink at the bar......great looking bar and loud but cool vibe. Terrible Bourbon options which was disappointing but overall drinks were fine.
We were seated in the dining room and had a relatively nice table towards the back of the restaurant which was nice as we werent so close to the bar which was picking up steam.
We started off with the raw bar which was tasty and pretty significant in size....but shame it came in a boring bowl.....I sort of like the big towers myself.
I had a wedge salad which was disappointing....very light on the bleu cheese and by the time they brought me more my salad was gone......that may be a me issue.
Anyhow, the other salads looked far better.
We decided to order sides for the table which consisted of Mushroom pot pie/tart which was incredible,parmeasn fries....also great,yukon gold mashed potatoes...very good,creamed spinach good and mac n cheese also good.My one complaint is that some steakhouses have decided that they are too cool for the traditional loaded baked. STK is one of them.
I had a bone in ribeye which was good....not great. Others seemed to enjoy their filets and fish.
We split a couple desserts....the most memorable a chocolate/peanut butter concoction.

We were seated in the lounge area with no offer of seats in the quieter restaurant section.  Given that my husband does not hear well and the DJ'd music is quite loud, this made conversation difficult.  I loved the 80s music but my husband was less thrilled by the club level music.

The wine list is stellar.  Many great selections at many price points.

Our waiter, John B, was excellent, knowledgeable and attentive as were the bus staff.

We had the baked oysters and the rice krispy shrimp as appetizers.  The baked oysters were the best we have had anywhere.  The shrimp was good.

Each of us had a steak.  They were well cooked and were very juicy.  As sides we had broccolini and mac & cheese.  I will say that I am over the pretentious decision of many restaurants not to have salt & pepper on the tables.  I like a salty steak and it would have enhanced the flavor for me.

Our daughter ordered the cheesecake pops for her birthday dessert.  This is where the new restaurant problems popped up.  We sat for more than 20 minutes waiting for this dessert.  It was clear that our waiter had too many tables seated at once.  The managers (or at least that is what we think the guidoish guys with the ear pieces were) seemed to point out problems more than pitch in and assist.  I will say that the cheesecake bites were tasty and free either because of the wait or the birthday, I'm unsure which.

FYI, both daughter and husband reported that hallway to the bathrooms is pitch dark, making it hard to distinguish which is which.

I would definitely try this restaurant again, in a few months.",2011-12-22 16:12:50

Sure sure sure, so this isn't ""authentic"" in any way possible, but it's about a billion steps up from Taco Time and about half the price. The tater tots are amazing.

Now the SALSA is where it's at! It's made fresh every day, and it's delicious. I get about 5-10 mini containers of it every time I come here. It's amazing. The secret ingredient in it is pineapple!

My absolute most favourite thing about Taco Louis is the perky owner who mans the counter. If you've eaten from here before, you know exactly who I am talking about. He clearly loves his business very much. He is friendly, charming, and is happy to accommodate. I always ask for extra cheese on my veggie burrito and he always obliges, no extra charge!

For some odd reason, Boston doesn't have that many vegetarian or vegan restaurants so when something new comes to town, I'm usually pretty excited. Yes, I was even one of the dummies that waited forever in a long line that snaked out the door on opening day, but it was worth it. Since then I freely admit that I probably eat here at least once a week. Doesn't hurt that I live within walking distance of by CHLOE now and so I'll pop in and grab a salad during the week. As a vegan, there are so few places in the world I can go and simply order off the menu without asking a million questions.

I love the salads although they are huge and I usually end up eating half for lunch and the other half for dinner. So consider that when you see the prices. 

PROS
*Close to where I live and it's all vegan
*I LOVE SALADS (can you tell?)
*Seasonal items break up the monotony of the regular and very limited menu. 

CONS
*This isn't healthy food even though it's vegan. When I see people chomping down on burgers, macaroni and cheese, and cookies and cupcakes, don't fool yourself about just how many calories you're actually consuming.
*The food is good but really inconsistent. Some days they are really good and other days, ugh -- I vow I'll never go back. The salad bowls will look half full on one day and full on the next. Fries can be soggy or dry. I just wish there was more consistency to the overall product. 
*Price - this place isn't cheap and I can't really understand why the prices are what they are. (Download the by CHLOE app, link your card for payment, and when you've spent $100, you'll get $10 towards future purchases. That makes it hurt a little less.)
*by CHLOE no longer has founder Chloe Coscarelli at the helm. That makes me nervous about the future of this brand. ESquared don't you dare consider adding meat to the menu because then I'm out. (Not sure what this is about? Just google Chloe's name.)

Overall, by CHLOE is a big addition to the dry vegan and vegetarian landscape of Boston. I'll keep going because as you can already tell -- I love salads. :)",2017-07-27 12:39:44

There was 80's music blasting which perfectly complimented the decor--white club style booths, shiny chrome and plenty of mood lighting. 

We had Adam as our server, who was friendly and helpful. The wine list had some very nice options too.  Our meal started with the complementary bread  which was spectacular.  It was a yeast bread with light garlic and butter topping.  The sauce served with the bread was delightful.  I am not sure what it was but it tasted light a strong olive oil that I couldn't get enough of.  Next was the fried calamari appetizer served with a smoky sauce,  which had my heart and tastebuds. I don't think I have ever had such tender calamari in my life.    

Unfortunately the steak I ordered was a huge disappointment.  I went with the Delmonico cut.  My steak was so tough and lacked flavor. I was literally jealous of everyone else's steak at the table.  I was sawing at my steak to try to eat it but ultimately gave up.  The cut was not trimmed properly because it had fibrous pieces which in my opinion should have been trimmed before cooking it.  Especially when considering the price.  I think my steak was about $60 and for this price I felt like it should have melted in my mouth.   I should note that I did not return my steak so I do accept that I had that option.   

The sides were good but nothing spectacular in my opinion.  We had the mac and cheese and added lobster.  I wish there was actually less cheese sauce because the pasta was swimming in it or maybe the sauce could have been more creamy and less soupy.   We had asparagus -YAWN and then the jalape√±o grits which had a fresh green flavor with a little heat but were cold.  

The verdict is that we will not be returning to STK because after all, it's all about the steak.",2018-11-10 01:10:03

So as a carnivore, I have to say that I really liked by Chloe! The decor is adorbs, the staff were patient, friendly, and funny, and the food was yummy! 

I got the Spicy Thai Salad, the french fries, and a coconut. Yes. A coconut! I would give it four stars just for the coconut! 

The Thai Salad was interesting - really really filling, with crunchy noodles, kale, and probably some comestibles I wouldn't be able to identify in a grocery store (I had to Google ""Tempeh""). I found the salad to be quite delicious. 

I also got the air-baked fries, and those were a bit harder and less crunchy than regular fries, but hey, they're carbs, I'll eat 'em! 

Finally, the coconut. I've had a bit of a food crush on coconuts ever since I was 10 and first went to Jamaica. This coconut was fresh and sweet, and I was able to scrape the sides for coconut meat. It took me right back to the islands, and was perfect for an overly warm spring day. 

I can't wait to try other things on the menu (maybe I'll even become a vegan! Okay...yeah, that will never happen).",2017-05-24 04:18:28

Pros and cons: 
Pro: Upon walking in, seating was quick and easy and I was handed a single red rose. 

Con: apparently a staff member had a group of female friends 2 tables down from us and kept sitting with them, complaining about the evening, and giving free stuff away. Seemed cheap. 

Pro: We were presented a special holiday menu with great choices. Each person could have a 3 course meal. I had oysters Rockefeller, steak with roasted Brussels sprouts, and a fruity dessert (I'm not a fan of sweets so I can't remember the dish, my boyfriend finished it) we also ordered a bottle of red wine. I enjoyed one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life. 

My boyfriend had been vehemently against Brussels sprouts and oysters of any kind his entire life....until he tried mine here at STK. He's now converted. 

PRO: Atmosphere was dimly lit and romantic, oddly enough, it was not busy whatsoever for valentines night. 

Atmosphere Con: we were sat very closely together with couples on both sides of us sharing a common ""bench"" style seating. We could barely have a private conversation with a business meeting occurring next to us and a couple on the other side all within arms length. Apparently this night Atlanta was hosting a cheer competition as well and over 30 children (all in cheer uniform) and parents decided to make valentine reservations at STK, it kind of killed the atmosphere for us, especially since one mom and daughter had a more private table to which her daughter (part of the cheer team and they sat separately from the group) laid down in the seat to relax and napped. They weren't their for the experience like we were. I expected more from a high class restaurant, especially on a holiday. But sometimes this can't be controlled. 

Service: our waiter was extremely attentive, constantly presenting the foods on time and in a calculated manner. We never received courses on top of one another, which is much appreciated, we were able to savor and finish what we were working on before being presented with a new dish and they cleaned any crumbs off the table each time before a new dish arrived. Staff was constantly cleaning all areas, even running sweepers after every table to ensure each guest had a clean new environment. Servers offered multiple suggestions on the menu and were very knowledgable. 

Overall I gave 4 stars because I expected on a holiday they would enforce a better dress code and not allow a party of a lot of children take over and be loud, I know if I give it another go round, It'll be different. The service, food, and everything else was amazing! We even witnessed a proposal at the table next to 2 seats down. Very sweet.",2015-07-02 03:28:25

There are usually only 2 or 3 people in line in front of me, but I always end up waiting 15-20 min to get a burrito...it is agonizingly slow. So today I ordered online about an hour before I got off work, thinking that this would solve the long wait time.  When I got there it was pretty empty, only one person in line.  I went up and said I had ordered online, the kid said there were no orders, then looks on the computer and says it's not ready yet.  He prints something out and puts it on the line and walks away without another word.  I walk over to the guy looking at the slip and ask if that's my order, because I don't want to wait for it, since I put it in an hour ago.  He insisted it just came in, so I just said I didn't want it and walked out.  Neither of them had an apology or even an explanation or anything.

I had a falafel pita chock full of lettuce, peppers, cucumbers, feta, and Greek dressing. Hubs had a chicken Caesar wrap that was tossed in Caesar dressing and then put in the pita.  The falafel and the chicken for both wraps were cooked on the grill which made warm pitas (the best kind!!)

He ordered the chicken and I ordered the filet mignon with the crab mac n cheese and parmesan truffle fries as our sides. Food was sooo delicious and my filet mignon was so juicy (with truffle butter on top) which reminded me of my experience at Mastros Steakhouse in Beverly Hills. My boyfriend loved the truffle fries since he didn't even realize he ate about 80 percent of it LOL. As far as the service, it was amazing!!! Our server was Bobby and let me tell you... he was absolutely wonderful providing us with honesty on food suggestions and what goes well together. Plus, he was very down to earth and checked in on us to make sure we loved our orders. He even took pictures of us and surprised us with champagne at the end of our dinner to celebrate our anniversary. So sweet!!

I arrived at 3 pm on a Friday. The place was not hard to find as it was just off the freeway and you could see the smoke from the grill as soon as you turned down the street! I pulled in and the servers were outside ready to expedite my order, but it wasn't necessary, there was only one car in front of me. Score!

Being it was my first time and that it was supposed to be ""fast"" food, I didn't want a long line of cars to start queuing up behind me so I wanted to be quick but have time to scan the menu too. The server was SUPER friendly and funny. Very good customer service. Even still, I needed to not worry, it's all pretty easily spelled out for you. The combo comes with two sides. Normal sides and funky ones too, like chicken nuggets or a quesadilla. I like nuggets, so I got a 1/4 burger, cheddar style (mayo, bacon, cheddar cheese, grilled onions) with a side of fries and nuggets and a strawberry shake. There were over 40 choices for a shake, but I went with the tried and true strawberry. If it passed the test, I will move on to more jazzier shake options. 

The food. Was good. Above average. I definitely like it more than 5 Guys! The shake though...the shake was HEAVEN SENT!!! It was super thick so I had to wait for it to melt a bit. But OMG, that shake was good. Definitely passed the test.

The mixed drinks are a bit pricey $12-15 bucks but you can still score a glass of wine or a beer for less than $10.

I'll start with the positive - the steak.  My filet was good to perfection and a great cut. The blue cheese butter was to die for. Everything paired well with the sides - brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. 

The rest was a total disappointment.  I received rude service from the hostess over the phone and was ""welcomed"" by a waiter who seemed to look at our table as another hindrance that evening. He didn't smile once, didn't even really talk for that matter to our table, and made our group feel like he had 0 interest in being there or providing good service. Disappointing considering what usually makes a high-end restaurant stand-out is their service. This trend of bad service continued on with their manager who didn't seem to care either about guests experience. While he did stop by our table, he didn't care to ask further as to what the issues were. 

Our appetizers and drinks were also a miss. It took forever to get bread to the table, the specialty cocktails were 50/50 (half of them we liked, the other half should just have been sent back). Our oysters were not cleaned well and the waiter did not even tell us what two type we were having. 

Finally, while I liked the Billboard 100 hit song list playing, making it fun and current the music itself was so loud we could barely hear each other. But, I guess that is better than hearing the prom taking place upstairs...",2017-04-24 18:37:24

The Food :

Parking Warning : 
Valet is only $3.00 and it is a affordable parking option right across the restaurant. I assumed it would be overpriced and paid a scammer $20.00 instead. Don't be like me, do better!!!

Pro Tip  :

Overall drinks were great and food was great. Service sucked enough where the server didn't deserve a tip what so ever!
The server didn't bother checked on us even once and every time we needed something we had to call him. There was no initiative. I would understand if we were picky or obnoxious but we didn't even ask for anything special. Just wanted a nice dinner and a get together but unfortunately that server wouldn't care!

No exaggeration;  40% kale, 40% wonton chips, 15% tempeh, and 5% rest of menu toppings.

We were told that our reservation had been confirmed for the upstairs dining area in order to accommodate a party of our size.  When we got to the restaurant, however, and after waiting for about thirty minutes, we were finally told that the upstairs area was no longer available and that we would need to sit downstairs.  As it turns out, STK management apparently had decided to close the upstairs dining area because the turnout did not justify dedicating the servers necessary to keep it open.  I understand that business decision, but the end result was that our party of twelve was forced to crowd around a much smaller table in a much louder environment that made conversation all but impossible.  

The service also was abysmal.  One other person and I ordered bottles of wine.  The server brought out the bottle that I ordered, presented it to someone else at the table and then poured that bottle out before even pouring any in my glass.  When I politely informed the server of the mistake, she disappeared for about ten minutes and finally returned with a different bottle than the one that I had ordered and attempted to pour that one.  Finally, after two or three tries, she came back to the table with the bottle that I had ordered and poured it correctly.   The end result was that we were charged for two bottles of wine that we didn't order.  Both servers had awful attitudes and were very flippant about that event and the entire service experience.  I guess they realized that, since an automatic 20% gratuity was going to be included, their performance was not important.  

My biggest complaint, however, was the quality of the food.  I can overlook bad service and seating confusion, especially from a restaurant that attempted to tackle a New Year's Eve celebration after being open less than a month.  But, food is food and either your chef and staff can cook or they can't.  At STK, they can't.  I ordered the bone-in fillet.  I have had a lot of steaks in my time.  This one was among the worst.  In fact, I don't want to overstate this, but I'm pretty sure that I've had better steaks at restaurants located just off interstate exits.  STK managed to do something that I wasn't sure was even possible--they served a burnt steak cold, an extraordinary feat of failure.  The tragedy was that this cut of meat was a very high quality cut and could have been well prepared with an even average execution.  Instead, STK somehow made it taste as though it had been wrapped in a dirty dish towel, marinaded in sink water and put in the microwave for about thirty minutes.  Simply awful.  

I would strongly recommend that you not dine at STK.  Save your money and just order a rib-eye from Longhorn or Outback.  Trust me, you won't be any more disappointed in the quality of the food and you will save yourself a couple hundred bucks.",2012-01-03 16:51:40

We took our 8 year old daughter who thought it was extremely fancy place. Shane was our waiter and that plus the food made our experience memorable. Since we had our 8 year old daughter with us, she was worried about what she could eat on the menu. She wanted a cheeseburger but Shane recommended the sliders and he put cheese on them. They were made out of Waygu beef and she absolutely loved them. Shane completely catered to her and she was very happy and full. In fact her face lit up when she bit into the burger. The only thing she wanted was ketchup.i sampled one of her burgers and the beef was savory and sweet.

Then I asked Shane about the best drinks on the menu and he recommended the Mule for me and it was delicious. My husband had the smoke drink with Bourboun with the large ice cube and it truly had a smoker taste. Shane also recommended the Lavender Me Up which I must say tasted like a sweet flower with lavender overtones.
The bread they bring to the table is shaped like a small bouquet with pure olive oil for dipping, Not only is the bread warm but it is soft as well. We chose the seafood platter for our appetizer. It came with several different sauces. The mustard sauce for the crab was delicious but my favorite was the champagne marina sauce because it had a citrus flavor combined with a hint of cilantro note.
For dinner we spilt a porter house steak with the Parmesan fries that remind you of the children's toy called Lincoln logs. Everything was delicious and I am truly glad that we went there. The steak was tender and the peppercorn sauce was was a great complement but not overwhelming.
Moreover, Shane was an excellent waiter and made our meal enjoyable. I think if most people had a waiter like him dining out would be an amazing experience. He was enthusiastic and sincere about the selections we asked about on the menu. Bravo to STK for a place with a lot of swag, food that does not disappoint and Shane who was extremely professional and courteous.P.

I'm not saying it was bad, by any means.  The food and overall experience was good, just not great.  For me, the environment is what saves it.  The forth star goes directly to the interior designer.  Pardon the analogy, but it feels like you are having dinner in a high-end strip club (that's a good thing, btw).

We had cocktails before dinner, you are kind of corralled in the bar ""holding area"" so just plan on a round of drinks to get started.  Once we were seated, the server greeted us.  He was pleasant and efficient but did not offer any direction or guidance.  At this level, servers should take the ball and run with it.  This ain't Chili's.  

We started with the Tuna Tartar, it was awesome, maybe the highlight of the night.  For entrees, we both had filet.  The sear on the steak was remarkable and they were cooked to the proper temp.  I had mine ""oscar style"", not sure I'd do it again... save the $15 and have another glass of wine.  The sides were good, but not memorable.

Surprising her with this impromptu trip was a hit, but the icing on the cake was bringing her out to STK for a cozy, delicious, late dinner.  

Walking in was a little shaky.  We were there at 9pm as our reservation was at 9:45.  At 9:55, we were still not seated even after a couple with no reservations was sat.  I reached out to one of the hostesses to express my concern. She cut me off in mid-sentence to tell me she'll be with me in a minute. After finally being seated at 10, they sat us at a table right by the door.  I was a little disgusted at that point and asked if there was anything available in the main dining room. The turnaround was when the host sucked it up and politely obliged my request for better seating.  She was very accommodating seating us in the main dining room in a more intimate setting.

Our server, Chantel, was nothing short of amazing. She was very attentive and anticipated all of our needs.  She made us feel at home and gave just enough personal touch to gel all aspects of our dining experience together in one nice little package.  She is exemplary of what a server should be. 

After Chantel greeted us with complimentary champagne for our anniversary, we ordered a couple of drinks from the bar... The Cucumber Stiletto and Not Your Daddy's Manhattan.  Both were delicious and well prepared.  For small plates, we had the seared foie gras and the beef tartare.  The foie gras was at its best with a crusty, light sear and that dreamy buttery rich taste.  The beef tartare was perfection. Just the right amount of mustard and capers to add that tang to the rare beef and egg yolk body of the dish.  We followed that with the fresh seafood platter which a tad underwhelming.  I feel like not much effort was put into the platter at all.  For our entree, we just split the 10oz Filet, med rare, of course.  Steak was prepared at perfect temp. We also scored big with our choice of the foie gras butter as a topping for our filet.  Our charming server Chantel finished us off with a complimentary skillet cookie and two shots for a night cap.  The warm chocolate chip skillet cookie so on point.  Perfect ending to a overall great ""but shaky at first"" dining experience.  I would recommend it if you are in the the area.

We went over the to bar for a drink and I ordered a drink with cilantro and jalepeno. A fantastic choice for me, but I would not encourage folks who don't like spicy to order it. We're just having a good time, chatting with the bartender, who then offered to go speak to the hostess at the front to try to get us into a table sooner. THAT MADE OUR NIGHT. How kind was that...he literally went to the front to try to get us a seat sooner. This made a HUGE DIFFERENCE. That bartender deserves a promotion or raise or something - that is what I call taking care of your guests at its finest.

We were seating and I ordered one of their salads as a side of mac and cheese and I was not disappointed.

Our server, Britt, was a delight. Attentive, charming, and helpful, he met each question and request with promptness and quick wit.

Prices are awesome, I'll give it that, huge portions for $5. The sides are way cooler than your average side dish. Corn dogs and quesadillas?  Awesome. 

Quality of the food, not so much. I ordered double burger, fries, and a corn-dog.  For a double, this burger is tiny!  I can see why it's so cheap. Corn-dog is tiny and subpar as well. Fries were decent. The banana pudding milkshake was super thick and impossible to get through the straw, but was delicious. 

Service wasn't bad, it sure was odd though, also I'm not a huge fan of bible verses on my packaging, or religious music being played aloud. If that's your beliefs, that's cool, but don't jam it down my throat.

I mean no one really aspires to work at Subway for their existence, ya know?

That said, I was really put off by my experience this go round. I was ordering my sandwich, a foot long veggie delight w ""pepper jack cheese"" (I say that last part loosely -- I think it was cheese food, more than actual cheese). Food aside, another patron walked as I was ordering my sandwich, cut the line, and started talking to the associate who was making my sandwich. Instead of saying, ""I will be right with you"" the associate let her cut the line, making everyone wait longer for their food. It's a silly grievance, but something that REALLY annoys me. If we all have to wait, why shouldn't you? And why wouldn't the staff at the restaurant say that?

About the cheese food -- I asked for my sub toasted with cheese. When it came out, the cheese was only half melted, and a bit discolored. This was about the time the other patron cut the line making us all wait longer, or else I would have asked for it tp be remade sans cheese. It was tasteless, mostly, which also makes me think it was cheese food.

The rest of the food -- really bland, not fresh tasting.

I have been there a total of four times now and can't say I have seen any smiles or received any warmth from any of their employees. They act as if it is a bother that you even walked in. 

The first time I went in there I ordered ONE bowl to go - it was about 45 minutes before closing time. I received the biggest attitude from one of the female employees after asking if it was still okay to order something to go: ""Hunny it's 45 minutes until closing time, usually you don't do that"". I repeated my question about being able to order and she had a sour look on her face and said ""go ahead"". Yikes!

I hated to give them last minute requests, but they were very gracious about it.

The food was AWESOME. Two people came up to me after to remark how fresh the salads were, how well the steak was seasoned, and how they could taste the lime in the chips. Several in our group are from Africa, and they accepted the chicken burritos with pleasure. I myself had corn tortillas, and I was surprised how thin, light and fresh they tasted. 45 minute after I brought them to our venue, the tortillas were still warm. Very nice! The salad ingredients were very fresh and crispy. People loved the brownies.

No leftovers!

A catered meal can be ordered on Panera's website with a few clicks. I couldn't easily order from the Qdoba website.

The customer who came in after us left after deciding that none of this was worth it. We however were starved after a long day at Disney and sought out this Jimmy John's. Approximately 10 minutes into our wait, the employee on the phone finally turned to us and held up a finger implying that he would take our order soon. About 5 minutes later a second employee strolled in from what I can only imagine was a break. He saw us and started to play the air guitar, when he made his way to take our order he made jokes and dragged out our stay even more. The first employee was finally off the phone so he began making our sandwiches, he took breaks to check his phone & twirl bread around in the air. They had the audacity to complain about previous customers. To top this whole experience off, our wait did not even pay off as 2 of our 3 sandwiches were made incorrectly.

However, we had called 45 minutes ahead of time to make reservations for our party of 10. They almost seemed surprised when we arrived right on time. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table.

I would imagine that this would be the type of place to go and conduct business or for a quiet romantic dinner for two. It is also not a place to go without very deep pockets. I am guessing that my meal with the appetizer, dessert, sides, and steak was over $100.

 so you may be wondering why I would give a STK steakhouse house a 3 rating? Well very simple. This was one of the finest pieces of meat that I have ever been served. It was absolutely cooked to perfection. The sauces were perfect complements. Does steak literally could be cut with my fork.

First the good and the great:
a) we were running late and called to inform the restaurant. The hostess was able to find our reservation and change it for us without any problems
b) The decor and interior of the restaurant was very sexy and nice. While it didn't match up to what the website advertised, it was still a pretty nice place although it could turn up the heat just a tad since the weather has been on the verge of freezing lately.
c) Most of the foods that we had and shared was pretty good, the corn souffle was delicious. It was sweet and savory and made me want to eat corn - which is not really my most favorite vegetable. 
The loaded baked potatoes were also delicious, you must have it with the skin on though cause it gives you a different texture. They also bring out these dinner rolls that are very similar to hot cross buns, but with blue cheese on it along with a chive butter dip. Both of these I could have gone without. The blue cheese took away from the bread, which in itself wasn't very flavorful, just really fluffy and the chive butter dip was an overboard of chives in it. Think melted chive in oil.
My sea bass was the best though, it was perfectly cooked and had the consistency of melted butter. I seriously cannot remember when I had such a piece of fish that was cooked so well. 
d) Valet was prompt and courteous which is great when you are wearing heels and hoisery shivering on the sidewalk
e) there was a couple sitting across from us who were obviously on a date who were not having much chemistry or talk between them. I guess the manager realized this as well and sent over 2 complimentary glasses of wine which helped chill the ice between them. That was a really nice touch.

Now the not so great:
e) The waiter did not really fully explain the specials to us. For instance, I opted for the lobster mashed potatoes thinking, all right, night out on the town I can splurge a bit. But boy, when my check came and my side was $23 compared to my $32 sea bass I was shocked to say the least. The mashed potatoes were ok, very creamy, but maybe warn someone when their $8 side comes with a $15 upcharge for a few pieces of lobster. I mean, H-Mart has lobster on sale for $6/lb!
Also, when we requested that the ticket be split, another diner who had opted for a grilled salmon with 2 pieces of shrimp on it was extremely surprised to find that the shrimp were $5/piece. We explained to the waiter that when you said Salmon with shrimp, then the shrimp automatically comes with it and not charged extra. That's like someone ordering oyster rockerfellers and being charged for the spinach and cheese on top. If it's a special and is marketed as such on one dish, then why are there 2 separate charges for it? The waiter could not give us a clear answer and not wanting to ruin the rest of our night, we decided to just pay up and leave. 

Also, the music is a mixture of revised 80's hits. Ok to when you want to remember the songs playing when you were born, but not all that otherwise.

I think that STK is one of those places that is more about being seen than having the best meal. Although a majority of our food was delicious, I don't think that the prices were in line for the portions.",2014-02-01 17:08:00

-- The food --
The taste is there. They do pitas, made to order, with some pretty delicious combinations. The portions are relatively small, but I guess that's part of being healthy- portion control. Unfortunately, the price seems a bit high for what you're getting, but I guess that's another result of getting healthy, quality ingredients. 

-- The service --
This place takes the ""fast"" out of ""fast food"". Granted everything is made to order, so its not a McDs where they just grab a big mac and throw it in a bag. But somehow the assembly line they have going here just slows things down. Everything seems way too complicated and time consuming. On the plus side, I have not yet received an incorrect order but when I'm stopping in for lunch, I want to make it quick. 

-- The decor --
Not good. The place overall is cold. The menu boards are arranged that you can't see the descriptions of the sandwiches until its time to order. And the tables are arranged that if there's a line you'll be hovered over. And forget trying to get seating for more than 4 together (2 is your best bet). Given the space and the layout, I suppose they're doing the best they can, but its just not good.

We asked for a different, smaller table and were told it would be 5 minutes (the restaurant was less than half full).  15 minutes later we check with the hostess and we had been forgotten.   OK - we are then seated quickly.  

Least expensive bottle of wine on the list is  over $60.  Mark up on their limited wine list is 200% or more.  Not sure why this is listed as $$$. 

Val is our server, and he is nice enough, but things move very slowly.  Takes 15 minutes for the wine to arrive.  Probably half an hour for the food to come after we order.  My $65 Delmonico was tasty, and cooked a little more than the medium rare I requested, but OK.  Not very tender though.  My colleague ordered the filet medium well, and the center is much redder than my medium rare order.  Val doesn't come back until we are finished.  Asks if we want desert, and never even comments that my colleague didn't eat his $41 filet, even though it is obviously cooked to rare, not medium well.

The asparagus ($13) was delicious as were the mashed potatoes ($13).  Would have liked dessert, but had to wait so long before Val came back we were ready to go.

The Bo Berry biscuits when hot and covered in icing are super delish. My roommate went through a phase where he bought a box of their fried chicken 3-4 times a week. He'd make his own sides at home to accompany his chicken and biscuits. He was lovin' it.

For some reason, the fries I got here last time were terrible. They were crunchy and hard like potato chips. Maybe burnt. 

I brought a coupon I received through email for a BOGO 2 piece dinner through their Drive thru. The employees were acting like, ""what in tarnation is this!?"" A manager was called, and I guess they figured out how to ring it up. The cashier was then insistent that it did not include drinks. I politely directed her attention to the words on the coupon that said ""drinks included"". She gave us an inadequate amount of condiments- good thing we had some condiments at home. 

So, yeah, study the fine print on your coupon in case you have to go into teachable moment mode. Also, sign up for their email list so that you can have good deals and discounts mailed to you. I think they gave me a free BoBerry biscuit coupon for my birthday. It was a nice gesture.",2017-04-07 16:33:51

I should've known this was just another trendy vegan spot, but I just had to try it for myself. I plan on going into detail, so make sure you're wearing your reading glasses.

The Interior: Very nicely decorated place with plenty of seating and air conditioning. The tables were clean and the condiments area was neat and well stocked. They also have outdoor seating which sounds like a good idea until the breeze from the waterfront starts blowing your food everywhere. The cashier was cool, I hope they're paying her well as much as they charge people here.

The Food: CRAP, which is why I'm not giving this place more than a star regardless of how decorative the interior is. I ordered the Pesto Meatball ""sub"" and Mac N' Cheese and both were lackluster. I was going to order a cookie, but the line was too long and I'm glad that I didn't! The prices for the bottle drinks were ABSOLUTELY ridiculous, try a bottled juice for $10...yeah OKAY Chloe.

The ""Sub"": It wasn't really a sub roll but more like a hot dog bun with so much crap on it that made the bun soggy. I went through about 5 napkins eating this thing because sauce was spilling everywhere! As far as taste, there simply wasn't any whatsoever! It comes with lots of toppings which makes it appear to be tasty and the meatballs were so small, soft  and mushy, I had to look and see if there were actually meatballs in my sandwich because it didn't feel like I was biting into a meatball nor did I taste anything but pesto! I basically ate a pesto sandwich for $9.95

The Mac N' Cheese: MEH, the shitake bacon on top was good I'll give them that, but the mac and cheese itself was pathetic. I honestly prefer Amy's Vegan Mac N' Cheese that you buy for the same price in the frozen food section at the supermarket, and no I'm not exaggerating. Thank god I ordered the small because it wasn't something that I'd recommend trying for $5.95

Overall even though I am disappointed I walked out my way to come and try this crap, I did get some good exercise walking back to work on my lunch break. But don't make the same mistake I did and waste your money here, unless you enjoy bland food. Bye Chloe!",2018-06-12 18:25:38

However, the line inside moved very, very quickly and I was able to get my food in a decent amount of time considering all the folks in there.  

The inside is small and crowded.  Honestly, I don't know how people can eat in there with all the people hanging over them like that and the loudness.  Anyway, let me get to the food.

I got the special for $4.99 which gets you a choice of a sandwich (there are about 8 choices), two sides, and a large drink (which could be a float if you want or a milkshake for an extra $1).  I found this to be an excellent deal.  However, by the time I added cheese and bacon to my quarter pound burger, it was $6.50.  I was fine with it because the sides include things like chicken fingers and corn dogs along with the standard fries and onion rings.  I got onion rings and a corn dog for my sides.  

I immensely enjoyed this food.  That grilled meat was magnificent as I'm a huge fan of that grilled taste.  I loved it.  Also, I tore up that corn dog.  I don't know why I adore a corn dog, but I do.  This one, as was all the food, hot and good.  The onions rings were just alright in my opinion, but not bad.  

I will not be able to forget that burger and will be back there this weekend.  This I know for sure.  I want to try a chicken sandwich and several milkshakes that are offered.  

This place was busy, but I found the system to be efficient and they handled the crowd surprisingly well.  There are only two registers and one person who calls your number when your order is ready.  This is done in record time.

This question was posed to me one night by The Bud shortly after I blurted out that we had to go to the Dairy Queen right that very minute or the Earth itself would wobble on its very axis.  [I'm aware it does this naturally, but I'm setting a scene of absolute melodrama here.  For those who don't know me personally, I'm occasionally prone to such outbursts.]

Yeah.  I said it.  I frickin' love the damned Dairy Queen.  No, I don't eat it often, but when I have DQ on the brain, no amount of fancy gelato or dollop of vanilla bean sitting atop some phenomenal dessert in a fancy establishment is going to squash the desire.  Nay, the need.  

The only thing that quiets the beast is a DQ blizzard with Butterfinger and Oreo.  There is nothing like it, and I know that 56th and Division has me covered, every time.  Their parking lot sucks on a multitude of levels, and their drive thru is a true oxymoron in the summery months.  None of that matters to me when I get the calling - the giant DQ beacon in the sky.

This is definitely one of those scene hipster places. Though I usually tend to avoid places like that (as they are undewhelming in quality but overwhelming in price), I heard the food here was actually good. So I came and tried it. And as usual, I was disappointed. 

I got the much hyped avocado burger, and I got no taste of the burger. I'd bite and I'd only taste the corn, chipotle aioli and bread. I literally had to cut off a piece of the burger to get a taste of what the patty was like. It wasn't worth the effort as it was underwhelming. 

The fries were okay. They weren't greasy which was nice, and the chipotle aioli was good. But when I eat fries, I like that crunchy, crispy exterior. I knew I wasn't going to get that with this ""air fried"" technique, but still, they were limp and slightly underseasoned.

Maybe I'll come here again (and brave the lines and price) to try the salads, but avoid the ""burger and fries"" if possible.",2017-09-15 01:23:41

This is why it's weird to me when people share a profile. No two people have exactly the same tastes. I tried my husband's dish and thought wow this isn't good. He finished it and said it was delicious. Did we eat the same dish? Here is my opinion about what we ate.

ENDORIAN FRIED CHICKEN TIP YIP - my husband describes this as a giant chicken nugget. To him this was a boon, to me that was disappointing. I found it to be a dry chicken nugget, he thought it was delicious. So...three stars? I thought the mac and cheese was decent.

FELUCIAN KEFTA AND HUMMUS GARDEN SPREAD - If these were real meatballs I wouldn't like them, but I admit, it's pretty impressive for plant based. My husband was even shocked that it wasn't real meat. They give you a lot of pita with it so it ended up being more filling than I was expecting. I am impressed that they give you a plant based option.

I downloaded the app and placed my order a cool 45 minutes before I scheduled my pick up time, thinking that would be plenty of time to make a simple salad. I arrived to the establishment at my scheduled time and noticed my order wasn't ready yet, so I waited by the counter for my name to be called. After about 10 minutes went by and my friend had gotten her food I decided to ask someone where my food was. I was told there might have been a mix up and they would check. This was concerning because the app said that was order was ready for pick up 20 minutes ago. The person came back out from the kitchen and said he didn't know where my food had went and they would make me another. Slightly frustrated I agreed thinking that my now 30 minute late order would be set to a top priority. After another grueling 20 minutes or so had passed I asked the man once again what was happening? I ordered a cold salad, not a hot meal, 20 minutes should be plenty considering the circumstances. Again the man told me he would check. When he came from the kitchen the second time he told me a little longer. At this point I had waisted around an hour and still no food in sight. I called the customer services for the app(Allset) and was able to get a refund. No food and an hour down the drain. The service was pretty bad and the food didn't look that good; I was in there for an hour I saw lots come by me.

1) my dirty martini was pure vodka with sour olives.. I told him I felt like I was taking a shot instead of enjoying a cocktail. I watched him bring it over to the bar tender and they poured in olive juice.. didn't remake.. didn't shake, didn't stir.
2)didn't realize we came on club night for our anniversary. A DJ playing early 2000 RB/Rap with a speaker right over our head at our table. How romantic of a vibe.
3)our table was so incredibly wobbly cutting my steak made everything shake on the table including our drinks almost pouring over
4)my steak was undercooked... my $71 ribeye (I like medium rare and it would still be mooing) 
5)champagne bottle sparklers.. do they know how much those smell once they go out? You might as well have a smoking allowed section in your restaurant. I love smelling burnt smells while eating your expensive steak? 
Seemed like everyone got one for something. We also got some. Personally don't like the attention.. let alone just.. don't get it.

All in all.. this is a different version of a dining experience. 
This restaurant has a mistaken identity.

Don't take a date here for the first time don't celebrate big moments unless it's a ""club party"" atmosphere.

I really loved this place I went once on a week day night and I loved how my steak was years back (2017). I don't know what happened.

It's time to share with you about one of Atlanta's finest restaurants. Its STK. 
 
When you arrive you can find parking in the parking deck alongside the building. Take your ticket inside, and they'll validate it for you. You're required to wear a face mask to enter the restaurant, and only when walking about in the restaurant. 

Upon my arrival a hostess found my reservation I'd made through Open Table. A second very nice hostess greeted me immediately thereafter, and took me to a high boy table within the bar area. This seating afforded me great views of the beautiful city. 

My waiter for the evening was Josh. He also served as a bartender, and this made for only fairly prompt service. For my entree I ordered the six ounce filet, Yukon Gold mash potatoes, and I had a Corona light. 

The steak was gloriously prepared. It was so tender that it cut like butter, and tasted magnificent! If you love steak STK is the perfect place to dine next. 

The restaurant has a great dj, and the music was hip hop, and lots of popular musicians were played. The vibe was on point, and beautiful patrons flooded in nonstop. The restaurant had soft lighting which created a gentle ambience. There's also a dance kiosk where you could create a short video. That is so cool! 

Check out STK when in Atlanta. You'll be very glad you did. If you enjoyed this review go to www.diarytalkandmore and click Dining Today to read more of my food blogs. Until next time be safe, and enjoy life to the full.

I have tried and love the Smoked Kaadu Ribs (Sticky Pork Ribs, Blueberry Corn Muffin, Cabbage Slaw), and the Braised Shaak Roast (Beef Pot Roast, Cavatelli Pasta, Wilted Kale, Mushrooms), I even love the sides that they serve with them. I can't believe how good it is! I also stole some shrimp from my wife's Yobshrimp Noodle Salad, and it's also very good.

For desert, we tried the Batuu-bon (Chocolate Cake, White-Chocolate Mousse, Coffee Custard) it's worth every penny, very delicious!

I also highly recommend their drinks, I tried and love the Moof Juice (Simply¬Æ Fruit Punch, Simply¬Æ Orange with Pineapple, Chipotle-Pineapple) and the Sour Sarlacc (Minute Maid¬Æ Limeade with Raspberry and Spicy Mango). Again, worth every penny.

The menu does give you that ""out-of-this-world"" experience with delicious food.

Obviously Disney is stepping up their food service, much higher class. The cost is a little higher too, but it's worth every penny to be able to get a delicious meal while at Disney, especially while enjoying Star Wars Galaxy Edge. The cast members stay in character while serving you, so if you're a big Star Wars fan, you'll probably appreciate the experience even more.

My favorites are the quinoa taco salad, the spicy Thai salad, and the kale caesar salad (I'm a salad person).

I'll be honest...the reviews seem pretty high but I'm not sure it's entirely for the food. Don't get me wrong, my 3 tacos were excellent value and pretty good. But I need to come here again and try the other things.

Are people in love with the fact this place has been here for decades or that the owners are friendly? Or that there is a mild bastardisation of the Mexican food in such a way that it's kind of endearing? I'm not sure.

My beef tacos were great! Hard shell and a sweet ground beef. Nothing here screams mexican in terms of the spices (I could be totally wrong). But you know what, it worked.  

I asked for all the fixings. Don't do that. There's a lot of value but it's pretty tough to eat when lettuce and guacamole is all over the place.  Unless of course you're into having a side salad on your plate.

The chicken taco was the same...but I think beef is the way to go. All under $10.

This place has this odd cultish following. When I was watching people order, you can feel that people that come here, come here a lot.

Allow me to say I love a good steakhouse and don't mind the accompanying price tag of said steakhouse. I've dined in some of the best in the world and this place was very high with paltry food. 

The bread they bring out is good but not exceptional 4/5. We paid almost $180 for an appetizer, one drink, 2 steaks and 2 sides. And this was after using a passbook voucher for $30. 

The prices are outrageous....even for a high end steak joint. Sides are $13 and aren't family style like typical steakhouses. Meager portions at best. The truffle fries were ok but too greasy. Mashed potatoes were bland and tasted boxed. 

Delmonico steak was eh (3/5) and the cowgirl ribeye was ok as well. The stk spicy sauce was good. The chimichurri was flavorless and too oily.

However, some vegans have some additional food constraints, so by Chloe has clearly labeled certain allergens on their menus: soy, nuts (specifically almond, cashew, peanut, pecan, walnut), gluten.

Of their collection of pastries, two are gluten free: Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Chocolate Cupcake with Vanilla Frosting.

My take: their chocolate chip cookies are pretty good, however, for those who are not diet-ly constrained, I suggest skip this cupcake.  It was lightly sweet with a different flavor and texture than I'm used to for chocolate cupcakes.

Tip:  if you're getting a cupcake here, take a peek before you leave the store.  Mine was on its side with frosting all fallen off by the time I reached my destination.  I spread the frosting back on, tucked the cupcake back in the holder, shut the box cover and shook it like crazy, up to 30 degrees askew, and it was perfectly fine.  Thus I suspect the person boxing my treat did not tuck it in correctly.

Their Raw Vanilla Bean Chia Pudding (chia seeds, madagascar vanilla beans, raw almond + cashew milk, raw agave  nectar, raspberries) wasn't very flavorful, but was otherwise fine.

It's basically tucked away around the corner from Starbucks - just keep heading on down the street and take a right into an open space between the buildings at Blue Mercury.

This location of By Chloe has a roomy dining area, though a bit smaller than their Fenway spot.

I ordered ahead:
Small Mac n' Cheese $5.95 - sweet potato-cashew cheese sauce, shitake bacon, almond parm
Old Fashioned Chocolate Chip Cookie $2.50

My bag was ready, but not really, since it was missing the cookie, and the bottom of the paper cup of pasta looked soaked through.  Yes, not very appetizing a beginning.  They got me the cookie left out in error quickly enough, but then the fork I grabbed from the utensil area was missing a tine.

Definitely not the smoothest experience, but the pasta tasted okay and was creamy enough despite the visible sauce to pasta ratio, and with the shells on the soft side of al dente.  I particularly enjoyed the smokey dry leathery mushroom slices.

***

On other visits I repeated orders of their
Whiskey BBQ Burger $11.95
Smoky Portobello mushrooms and seitan, grilled pineapple, onion marmalade sauteed kale, bourbon bbq and potato bun
The Guac Burger $10.95
Balck bean-quinoa-sweet potato patty, guac, corn salsa, lettuce, tomato, onion, tortilla strips, chipotle aioli, and whole grain bun

I liked both, but found the BBQ the stronger flavored, while the Guac had the better contrast in textures.  Both were sufficient for a light meal on their lonesome.

Although I now see that they offer a combo deal with two of their burgers - Guac Burger and Classic Burger - which comes with a choice of fries (Original or Sweet Potato, $4.25 a la carte) and a drink (freshly brewed iced tea, seasonal lemonade, coffee, $3.50, still water, sparkling water, $2.50) for $13.95.

***

Went back for the combo $13.95 - Guac Burger, Sweet Potato Fries, Lemon Lime Basil seasonal lemonade.

The food was just north of room temperature.  Does it ever arrive hot?  Huh... no idea.

The sweet potato fries were pretty good though burnt on the edges.  Between the fries and the burger, there was some hit of spice in my meal, but as I ate, it was hard to tell the source.  The lemonade was pretty refreshing, though basil was the predominant flavor.  It came with a paper straw, which was fine at first, but as I drank on, the straw got a bit unpleasantly mushy.

By Chloe has recycling.  Nice!  But they don't clarify what is recyclable and what isn't, which makes it difficult for me to be a good doobie.  Ugh.  But it turns out that they have folks who sort the stuff in the back.  So, yay!

Checked out their prepared foods fridge:
Matcha Kelp Noodle $5.95 6oz in a teeny plastic mini bowl
Kale Artichoke Dip $5.95 for 8oz (but comes with chips)

I decided to give the Matcha Kelp Noodle $5.95 a spin out of curiosity.  The portion was tiny, so surely the taste would make up for it.  No, not really.  It was okay, but nothing special.  Though it was a bit better with a squeeze of the included wedge of lime.

***

This time, it was a side by side battle between the pastas:

Small Mac n' Cheese $5.95 - sweet potato-cashew cheese sauce, shitake bacon, almond parm
Avocado Pesto Pasta $6.25 Avocado cashew pesto, grape tomato, almond parm

Both were well sauced and tasty.  The pasta in the pesto seemed heartier a tad probably due to the shape, although both leaned towards over cooked/soft.  It also felt a tad healthier of the two, probably due to the association of green to healthiness since it isn't really a cheese sauce in the mac n' cheese anyway.  I still like the ""bacon"" though.  The pesto also came hot, while the mac n' cheese was room temperature/cool, and I had come on the early side of lunch.",2019-06-10 02:05:52

We scheduled our reservation weeks in advance and were really looking forward to it.   The vibe was young, sexy and trendy.   A lot of the hostesses had on sexy, short and/or tight clothing but they wore it well.  If you are insecure or have a partner with a roaming eye,  just know there is a lot to see. We arrived a little early and were promptly seated.  Our waitress gave us some recommendations,  and we settled on the 6 oz.  filet,  ribeye,  mac-n-cheese,  asparagus,  beer and a cocktail.   It took a while for our food and they were behind on bread so we were a bit hungry.   Our waitress told us that because we ordered well done,  it should take 45 minutes.  OK, it is 8 o'clock on one of the busiest nights,  we're cool. 

Once our food arrived, we were eager to dig in.   Once we took a closer look we noticed our streaks were both bleeding.   Once we cut them,  they were both fuschia inside.   I was super hungry and would have ate medium well but this was plain medium, maybe even medium rare.   WTH.  

This place is advertising as a steakhouse and they don't know the difference?   So we ask them to cook a bit longer.   The food comes back after maybe 15 minutes and is burned and my meat (which was already quite small.. Looked like 4 oz instead of 6) has shrunk into 2 burnt silver dollars.  The waitress then tells us,  they don't guarantee well done steaks...would have been nice to know when we ordered.  Our steaks were $41 and $49...no way were we going to just suck it up and pay.   So we ask for a manager.   He explains they cook their food on a broiler which sometimes burns the outside if it cooks long.  

Hmmm,  okay.   Would have been nice to know that too.  At this point,  we've waited over an hour,  our sides are cold and our meat is burnt.   We decided to eat the sides and ask them to take the steaks off our tab.  We paid for our drinks and sides and left. The atmosphere was nice and I'd come here for a drink but I can't do the food.  As other reviewers mentioned the food was way overpriced.  I mean, $6 per shrimp?!

The waiter was friendly and food was served on schedule. I got a steak of course, a filet with the blue butter sauce. Getting one of the sauces with your steak is a must and this one didn't disappoint. It's the same sauce they bring with the bread that's out of this world but pace yourself. The bacon appetizer was savory and delicious. I also got the fig salad which was large enough to share. The donuts dessert you can't go wrong. We took the rest with us for later. They also made it special by giving our table complimentary cocktails and something with a sparkler in it for the bride that made it special and added to the festive vibe.

I was disappointed in thinking that it's one of those place to be seen... I didn't get that while I was there. I didn't care for the music genre they were going for either. It was boring to me. 

On to the food. I have to say, everything was delicious except for the truffle fries. I eat, sleep and dream of truffle fries all day long and I can attest to their fries to be the most disappointing of all. For those who's never had them... try other places before giving them such a high rating. It was just fat steak fries with no truffles... I was able to get a whiff of it at the very bottom... meh.

My $65 new york strip was very chewy. The flavor was amazing, but it was so chewy. I think they cooked it just a bit too long so my jaw was locking up. It wasn't enjoyable as I thought. But the flavor was spot on. The corn pudding was my most favorite side there. I could order just that and eat it all day long. 

My other issue with this place is when they're telling us the specials of the day... why not throw in the price so it wouldn't be misleading afterward. My friend got a salmon dish with 2 grilled shrimps as topping. When she got her check, she was charged $5 per shrimp, and there's 2 shrimps on her salmon - on top of the salmon dish... It's not a big deal if she knew in advance that the topping was an option to omit if it was an additional fee.

The BLT

The Classic Burger (I prefer the Guac one, but both are good)
The Guac Burger
Oh So Fancy Fries
Air Baked Original Fries -- Without a dip, these are tastier.
Air Baked Sweet Potato Fries -- crispier than the original ones, which I prefer, I also think they may go better with dips)
Both the Chipotle Aioli & the Beet Ketchup are good, but I slightly prefer the Chipotle Aioli.
Freshly Brewed Iced Tea (good, but not sure its worth $4)
Nacho Secret Nachos
Smashed Avocado Toast
Sweet and Salty Brussels Sprouts with Scallions Market Veggie
Blue Lagoon Smoothie Bowl -- its unfortunately rather small for the money; I prefer the bowl over just the smoothie.


The items below are also pretty good and I get them once in a while:
Chicky Chicky --  The BBQ Sauce is better than their Honey Mustard or Buffalo sauces.  I only recommend the tenders.
Nicoise Salad  --  The tuna is not like tuna at all but tasty.  
Matcha Kelp Noodles -- Very unique, tasty
Southwestern Quinoa -- something different
Spicy Thai Salad 
Kale Caesar Salad    
Avocado Pesto Pasta -- it basically very pesto-ey pasta  
Sesame Ginger Soba -- it could be a bit more flavorful 
Turmeric Wellness Leaves + Flowers Tea (not sure its worth the $)

I do not recommend the items below:
Chicky Chicky Parm
Crispy Chicky Salad 
Butternut Squash Bisque with sage and maple wheat croutons

THE ABSOLUTE WORST DECISION I COULD HAVE EVER MADE. It's  my birthday, therefore we were taking pics, etc. Before we were seated the manager comes over and tells us there's no picture taking allowed in the dining room. Ok cool. 

My party consisted of about 20-25 people. My reservation was for 8:30pm. We arrived accordingly, everyone placed their orders, accept for one person. When my guest attempts to place an order, they tell him the kitchens closed and that the cooks are eager to get home at a decent time. Mind you, we were seated at 8:30-45pm. It's right @10pm now and our food which we ordered once we were seated still hadn't arrived. So I approached the manager asking if he could make an exception and allow my guest to order a meal being that it is my birthday, and no one out of my party's food had been brought out at this point. He told me no, there's nothing he could do. From the time we walked in, he had it out for us. I told him he'd been an asshole since we walked thru the door, we are well paying customers just as anyone else! 

When we arrived to STK, the entire restaurant was completely empty just about. There were maybe 2-3 tables taken out of the entire restaurant. So there was no reason as to why our food took so long. Right before 10pm, we notice a group of approx. 4 people, followed by a group of approx. 12 people enter the dining area. They were seated. One of the the guest just so happened to be ""Famous"". I won't say his name. They ordered. Around 10:30pm, the waiter delivers food to the party of 4's table. At this time, our food still hadn't arrived; on top of the fact that I had my kids with me that have school in the morning, which is highly noticeable. So the waiter walks out with a two platters full of food. We're thinking, ""ok great, here comes the food."" The waiter walks directly past our table with all the food and goes to serve the famous guys table that had just arrived right before 10pm, all of their food. 

At this point, I'm highly upset. I approach the manager, and stated, ""since you couldn't even make an exception for one person out of my party, can you please explain to me why the tables that just arrived have their food before my table. He gets an attitude and goes to the back; as if he's about to push our order out at a faster pace! We go back and sit another 10-14 mins waiting on food. By now it's 10:45 and we have no food. They didn't even bring the bread until 10pm. So now here comes the waiter again with more food, but it doesn't come to us. It goes to the famous guys table. 

At this point we walk out. With no food! After all that time. My birthday dinner was ruined. No one got to eat. So as a courtesy, we didn't pay for any of the drinks out brought out. Thanks for the drinks STK. Thats about all they're good for. 

The service was very bad. The waiter came back to check on us one time, during the entire time. The manager is a complete Uncle Tom/ AxxHole. If you're not, a celebrity or ""white person"", they will mistreat you and under service you. Take your celebrations elsewhere! Never will I go back to STK.",2019-03-04 16:48:16

When we arrived at 9:16 for our 9:15 reservation, the hostess asked us to have a seat because there were no tables available. No big deal. I mentioned the dinner was for Father's Day AND a birthday, and she said she'd let my server know about the occasion. We waited until 10:08 and were escorted to the table. 

After sitting down, we waited 17 minutes for the server to greet us and bring us water. Pretty simple, however we asked to put our food order in at the same time as the waters and our server disappeared for at least 30 minutes... lemons and straws didn't come until midway through dinner. 

We came to get crab cakes and lobster ravioli but they were out of both, ironically. We should have left at that point but decided to stick it out since it was already late. We ordered calamari instead. It came out fine, but THEN... the food runner brought out my lamb and it was colder than my mixed cocktail! The asparagus was freezing to the touch like it came out the fridge. There was no garnish, no micro greens or pomegranate seeds, no sauce... NOTHING! Just lamb and asparagus. We waited for about 10 minutes for our server to come back to tell him the food was cold and we had no silverware. 

He took my plate and apologized (Val was VERY personable, btw. Just overworked... he did the best he could. He is the reason for the extra star). When he came back with the new lamb, it came with all the garnish and he mentioned the Chef not being able to dress the previous plate because he had to ""man the grill"" due to staff shortages. 

As we finished up dinner, we noticed our server was clearly occupied somewhere else. He verified that when we saw a famous music artist walk out with a party of about 25 people. Val came over and basically said because i have to serve someone more important than you, your experience was not as valuable... (his excuse for our bad service). We never got the birthday surprise because we were ready to go by the time he came back with the check. We paid and tipped 18% anyway because he was nice.

As we walked out, I looked for the manager who was found at the bar getting a back rub by one of her employees... as well deserved as it may have been, it was inappropriate and could have taken place somewhere else. I pulled her aside and mentioned to her that we never got the birthday dessert that we came to celebrate. After a brief exchange of questions, she coldly shrugged saying ""ok, I'll address that with your server..."" 

I know we were not spending thousands like it's so easy to do when celebrities come in there, but for $250 we could have done this evening somewhere else. They took 10% off the check for the lamb instead of comping it, plus Val the server was nice. These are the two stars. The missing 3 come from the basic food mistakes, lack of attention to detail, and lacking customer service. Have a great day everyone.",2019-06-17 14:00:53

Worse is the hostess was neither friendly, nor apologetic about telling me that I have to wait around until something simply opened up.

I ordered the fillet, which honestly wasn't that bad, the truffle butter condiment on the other hand was a complete waste. For my side I tried the mac & cheese, which I found to be disappointing. It had a weird roasted peanut taste that, had I order roasted peanuts might have been okay, but I ordered mac & cheese. I mentioned it to my waiter and he kindly offered to bring out a couple other appetizers hoping that one of them might suit me better. How'd that work out? 1) a frothy corn pudding that appeared so undercooked that it was difficult to even look at and 2) a mushroom pot pie a la frozen center. Bon appetit!

Unfortunately that was not the case today. Our server seemed to be more focused on the table of 6 females at the table next to us. They received their bread, drinks and food in a timely fashion. Attention was paid to them most of the evening. Not the case with my table however! Our bread never came. The sides also showed up an hour after the steaks. The server blamed it on a system outage. That's interesting especially since everyone else seemed to be getting their orders with no problem. We requested the manager to come speak with us at the table and they refused, which is just totally bad business practice. As for the food orders... one of the steaks which was ordered with a specific sauce never came out with the sauce. Some waited so long for their sides that the entree got cold.

What's also nice is that there was seating to accommodate a family of six, and it wasn't overcrowded like the rest of the park.

the have pre-made pita ideas on the menu but you choose your own toppings, everything.
I love going here for lunch or dinner. Eating there, or taking it with me. They have cookies you can add to your meal that taste like heaven. You can also get different flavored pita chips with different flavored hummus. They have free refills on the drinks too :)

If you have a craving for fried chicken and have to take transit, this place inside the HMart in Aberdeen Mall is farily easy to get to.  Don't expect good  or friendly service from these people though.  It's a bare bones food court -- tiny and cramped.  But your cravings will be satisfied.  You pay at the bakery cashier counter opposite the BBQ and self-serve counter and that is where you get some paper napkins and a small paper cup for water (there's a water dispenser in the tables area, near the back).   I haven't seen any paper plates or anything if you want to share the self-serve bucket chicken with another person --- food not bad but the setup could use a lot of improvement.

I am impressed, actually. In an area where just about every fast food establishment aside from Chick-fil-A and their magical Jesus chicken is a bonafide s#!thole employed by the most indifferent and lackluster staff imaginable, Del Taco has been open for over a month and still manages to serve hot food with smiling faces in a reasonable time frame. They even know how to keep the drive thru going! 

Your tacos will feel a little fuller than Taco Bell. They have great queso and you can get a small side of it with chips for under $3. They have tacos with onions and cilantro like the real OG Mexican spots.

I got myself a combo that included their delicious Guac Burger, fries, and a home-made ice tea. The amount of food was just perfect, at least for me, as it left me satisfied and energetic, rather than full and lethargic. 

The preparation and presentation of the food were also stellar: unassumingly original, simple, practical. The burger itself consisted of a black-bean-quinoa-sweet-potato patty, with just the right amount of well-placed fresh guac, which came with tortilla strips and corn salsa for added crunch and -Mexican- taste, not to mention the standard lettuce, tomato, and onions, all held together by just the right amount of delicious chipotle alioli and a whole grain bun. 

I could write a lot about the actual venue, but suffice it to say it was clean, spacious, and eclectic, like a fancy loft belonging to a new age, generation x artist (sorry millennials!), but still managing to pull off an all-welcoming, family-friendly atmosphere! 

Friends, all that  for less than $15!! So, if you happen to live in or be visiting Boston, pay a visit to By CHLOE and enjoy a delicious, healthy, modestly-priced vegan meal in a great place; I guarantee you will not regret it!

As always, I encourage everyone to make their own decision if they so choose. If you do go, get the Brussel sprouts, they were fantastic. For a more detailed account of my experience continue reading. 

I was in the mood for steak before an 8:00pm show at the nearby Fox Theatre, so I decided to give STK a try based on their reviews and potential to be among the best steak options in the area. I left unsatisfied and do not believe I would give them a second chance. I didn't visit STK for great service or ambiance, I visited for a great steak. Unfortunately, that's where their biggest blunder of the evening took place. They committed a steak house cardinal sin, overcooked beef. I ordered the 16oz sirloin, medium rare with no additional options. It came out with a solidly gray center, I was heartbroken. I suppose there was some pink in the center if you squinted, but I visit upscale steak restaurants under the preconceived notion that regardless of any service related issues the meal will all come together anchored by a perfectly cooked piece of meat. 

Service wise, I had no major issues. I arrived early for my reservation and was seated late, but that's par for the course at a lot of these restaurants. My waitress was nice enough, but could've been more attentive. My steak was delivered by someone from the kitchen, who didn't allow me to cut into it before zooming back in. Ten minutes passed before she visited my table to see if everything was prepared to my liking. I informed her it was not, and she agreed that the steak was overcooked. I was offered another steak, but had to decline because of the show at the Fox. It was about 7:30 when she offered a replacement steak, and my show started at 8:00. Had I gotten my food out quicker, it would have been salvageable probably. 

Another interesting practice that I've not seen before is their sauces. Every steak is served with one. The hallmark for me of a well prepared steak is that it doesn't need help from a sauce. 

I also ordered a wedge salad, which was delicious. The tomatoes were great, harvested at a peak time with just the right amount of sweetness. The blue cheese was also great. This salad was large, enough to share. 

As a side I ordered Brussel sprouts, these were the star of the show given the overcooked steak. They were paired with bits of bacon and a sweet glaze of some sort. They tasted fantastic. Enough for two to share. 

The bread that came out ahead of everything was also delicious. It was paired with some house made blue butter and oil. 

I ordered two cocktails, the ginger mojito and the STK mule. They both tasted okay, but the mojito came out warm, as if they forgot to chill it in a shaker before adding it to a glass. Overpriced, as is traditional for these types of establishments.",2017-04-30 14:10:50

It's a kind of food court/cafeteria-type place where you order from a smaller selection of dishes that come out fairly quickly. 

The dinner/lunch menu is kind of American/Asian-adjacent, with beef, chicken, seafood, and vegetarian options. 

You can tell they put some thought into the 'Star Wars' aspect of the dishes--e.g. the kids meals have (what I think was) broccolini but some kind of interesting white variety you don't see in the grocery store, the chicken was in a kind of elongated stick form (which doesn't sound appetizing but was). It's just little details that kind of made you feel like you were eating exotic food on a foreign planet given the setting.  

I ordered the aforementioned Endorian Fried Chicken Tip Yip, which was good, but I also tasted the Roasted Endorian Chicken salad and it was great! 

It's also a place that lets you order ahead on the Disney app and pick it up when you get there which was simple, easy, and avoided the line!

Overall, our experience was very meh, considering STK has been labeled one of the top restaurants in Atlanta. We ordered half a dozen oysters, the lamb ribs, horseradish-crusted grouper and a side of the lobster mac and cheese. The oysters were all right and the lamb ribs were flavorful, but not amazingly enough to justify the hefty price. The grouper was probably the most disappointing - there wasn't much flavoring to the dish and the side vegetables were also quite bland. As for the lobster mac and cheese, they don't skimp on the lobster, but the overall portion is small and really not worth the $23.

Also, the ambiance here was somewhat confusing - it seemed as if they were going for a romantic atmosphere, but at the same time, there was a DJ playing remixes of current chart hits, which also gave off a sleazy, club-like vibe.

Everything tasted wonderful however for those that do not eat meat be aware that the Brussels are cooked with bacon. (Our server was great about advising us of this when ordering). They also had a great cocktail menu and variety of wine selections. 

Ambiance: The establishment was upscale, clean and dimly lit. They had music playing at the perfect volume and I could see that they had a DJ setting up just as we were leaving.

I love the lighting and ambience of the restaurant.  We were sat towards the front by a window which I was worried would be crowded but wasn't.  I also liked the DJ.  He played a mix of 80s, 90s, and early 00s.  
  Their bread is SO good.  Literally the best bread I've ever had in a restaurant.  The green sauce is a chive/olive oil mix (I asked our waitress).  For drinks, my boyfriend had a Manhattan and I had The Great Gatsby.  Both were good but mine was a tad sweeter than I would have wanted.  The appetizer was the only miss.  We ordered their scallops which were served like a BLT with fried green tomatoes, and oily lettuce.  I literally ate one scallop and my boyfriend ate the rest as the appetizer was oily and gross and not well put together.  I'd get the oysters or tuna tartare if it were my choice.
  We both ordered filet for dinner.  He got the 10 oz and I got the 6 oz both grilled medium rare.  The steak was the best part of the meal.  The STK bold sauce is nasty though.  Tastes like spicy ketchup; I swapped it for red wine sauce but honestly you don't need much sauce.  We ordered the lobster Mac and cheese which was divine and the cauliflower au gratin because I love cauliflower.  I could have eaten the entire thing it was so good.  The sides are HUGE, two was too much for two hungry people so you definitely don't need more than one per person.  They are $10 each but are family style.

Went during Happy Hour (M-F 3-6pm) after seeing Ads online. As a cocktail lover, I went to try their cocktails. 

I ordered their happy hour cocktails and bites: strawberry cobbler cocktail and Cucumber Stiletto cocktail + $2 oysters, $5 Lil Brg + Truffle fries, $5 Tater tots (Cheese inside!!), $7 filet, and $8 jalapeno shrimp cocktail. 

Their cocktails were really great. They had 3 cocktails for the happy hour price of $7. Strawberry cobbler was fruity, and it was special with graham cracker crust on the rim of the glass. The base was Belvedere vodka, so you know it will taste pretty smooth. Cucumber Stiletto cocktail base was citron Grey Goose, and it had muddle cucumber and mint flavor. We got extra cocktails because they tasted great. I recommend the Strawberry Cobbler, because it was a more special drink :) 

Little bites (as in really literally little!) were all part of their actual dinner menu. It comes from either STK's appetizer or side dishes, and we tried 5 different kinds because they were all pretty reasonably priced. I recommend the truffle fries (I could taste the truffle oil..loved it!) and tater tots (it is special because it has melted cheese inside...so yum). I wanted to try other things on the menu, but we got too full.

ATMOSPHERE
Nice, upscale, and classy. Was very pleased with the establishment, with it being my first time there, and because of the hype around it.

FOOD
We got the filet topped with crab, and the salmon. The filet and the crab were absolutely 5 stars. Do NOT get the chimichurri. The salmon was just OK.
Also got the manhattan and a pinot grigio. Just OK.
It was a special occasion, and we had the servers bring drinks and cupcakes with sparklers, was awesome, only problem is we had to pay for it! Lame.

SERVICE
Our server was very attentive and very patient with us, especially because there were so many of us, and we got drunk, and were very much the loudest people in the restaurant. Kudos to her!

However.......

The bad - this place is a nightclub.  The music is unbelievably loud.  My 3 friends and I could not hear each other at all. We complained several times and I felt bad for the server.  He couldn't hear us to take out order.  He couldn't hear us when we complained about the music.  We couldn't take it anymore and asked for the manager.  The first manager came over and basically laughed in our faces. To make matters worse, he was dressed like a farmer. Seriously - an untucked denim shirt, faded jeans, and keys dangling on a chain.  Looking at this place, I'd expect someone with a little more pride in their appearance.  My party of four, the party of 6 next to us, and two tables with a party of 2 each were all told ""there is nothing we can do about the loud music, it's just what we do.""  Hmmm.....""just what we do.""  A group of 14 people were basically told that the loud music is much more important that your experience.  We were told by several servers that people complain every night about the music, but they won't change their policy.  We won't return, and I'm sure the other 10 people won't return either.  To sum it up, the restaurant lost 14 customers in less than two hours but the manager acted like we were the problem.  Unbelievable.  The cherry on the top ----- the bill was over $300.

An employee told us what he liked, so we bought that and liked it better than the other dishes our friends tried. The Roasted Endorian Tip-Yip Salad was our favorite: Mediterranean-flavored chicken with Caesar salad (plus kale), seasonal veggie (tender sweet potato), quinoa, and pumpkin seeds.

The most popular item is what's pictured on the menu, but 3 out of 4 of us didn't care for it (bland; looks like a fish stick on top of mashed potatoes with baby food pea pur√©e). The beef dish was okay, a little dry, but better than expected for having to pump out so much food in a day.

The quantity of each dish wasn't huge, but that worked for us because we like trying other treats along our journey.

Speaking of... the blue milk around the corner tastes like if a blue Slurpee was made into milk and frothy. Really sweet and not at all enjoyable. I wish they would've just made blue-colored whole milk.

Decor wise this place made us feel like we were on another planet, especially since the employees talk to us like we're all in Star Wars. They don't ask if you need a receipt, instead they say something about a supply requisition form or something. We aren't the role player type, but can see how someone who is would be stoked to be talked to like that. It just confused us.

Tip for Galaxy's Edge: you'll get on the ride faster if you go through the single rider line (we waited maybe 10 minutes), but that means you may get stuck with random people (or kids) who can't pilot a space ship, causing you to crash through the entire experience and make it miserable.",2019-10-07 21:21:45

""Delicious meat but salty""

- New name. Same exact menu with minor name changes, and even continuing to use Extreme Pita bags. Who are you, counter service take out restaurant?

- A price increase of $1-2 per item. 

- Now offering smoothies and coffee, suspiciously in tandem with announcing the co-branding of Surf City Smoothies before the name change. Surf City Smoothies are no longer in the house, and they're selling vacuumed coffee dispensers, new in-box, for $25.

- Stale af pita chips. Or severely under toasted. Take your pick.

- No more chipotle hummus. 

- Chicken is cubed in to huge chunks and barely warmed on the griddle. The wraps as a whole (and in direct comparison to what they once were) have severely dropped in quality. 

The whole place feels off. It's like walking in to an 8-12 convenience store and getting a Big Glug or maybe a Sippee. If you're not Extreme anymore, do something wholly your own, because this sort of imitation is the opposite of flattery.",2018-12-30 04:09:52

We were seated promptly. Drinks and appetizers were good. Then there was no bread for a 7:00 PM seating on a popular holiday! And we loved their rolls from our last visit.

I saw lots of guys in a t-shirt and jeans and I dined there on a Thursday. Things may be different on a weekend, however, so I'd relegate your mandals and jorts to M-Th experiences.

The food? Great, as it should be. We ordered steak tartare for the appetizer and were not disappointed. For the main course I got a small filet (6oz?) with horseradish and broccolini, he ordered the bone-in filet and I wish I'd gotten that instead (however minus the STK bold sauce- too sweet), along with the creamed spinach. The creamed spinach was good, perhaps a bit heavy on the salt, though. 

The atmosphere was... interesting. The interior is very Midtown, nothing wrong with that, and there is a live DJ playing music. The downside to the live DJ is that it's rather loud, so I don't recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere quiet and intimate. The tunes are good, but on a slow Thursday night (it was monsooning outside, I assume that had an impact on things) it was entirely too loud for my tastes. Could they have turned the music down a notch or two? Sure, but they didn't. This is Midtown, after all, we are TRENDY! Also, as I mentioned, it was rather slow. When I arrived just before 8 the restaurant was nearly empty with just 2 tables being occupied, yet my party of 2 was still seated in a tiny booth in which we were forced to sit next to one another, which is a bit inconvenient for eye contact when conversing and elbow room when you're cutting a piece of rare meat every few minutes (because classy people eat one bite at a time, and we don't cut our entire meal up into bites all at once). Subsequent parties or two were repeatedly seated in the larger booths, leaving us squenched into our crappy little table and I'm 5'10, so that was annoying, but I digress.

Dinner for 2 along with 2 glasses of wine and a bottle of Voss was ~$200.  They get 3 stars because I still think Rathbun's is better.",2013-06-17 04:19:02

I was in ATL for work and within walking distance of STK. I asked a coworker (who is local to ATL) and she had never been before either. So we both went there on a Thursday evening. We got there about 5:30p and were seated right away. After a while, our waiter came to greet us. I ordered a glass of the Justin Cab. However, I was already somewhat annoyed because a glass was $15. I've purchased that exact same bottle of wine at the grocery store for less than $30. I get that there will be a markup on wine, but this one was excessive. 

The wine was great, which I knew it would be. Our waiter also brought us bread which was probably my favorite thing by far. It was warm and delicious and came with an excellent green dipping oil. I probably just could have eaten the entire loaf for dinner! 

Eventually our waiter came back and we ordered our food. We both opted for the 10 oz filet and a side. I got the tater tots side since I love all things potatoes. The filet was $49 and the tots were $13. 

After we ordered, I felt like it took way too long for our food to come out. They weren't even that busy since it was a weeknight. We finally got our food and it was okay. No different than any other filet I've had before. They have a house steak sauce, which I used, but didn't really like. The tater tots were homemade and oversized. I didn't really like them. They came with some type of a spicy dipping sauce which I didn't enjoy. I wanted to ask for ketchup but we couldn't find our waiter anywhere. By the time we found him, it was well over 10-15 mins since we had our food. My coworker flagged him down (he walked past our table without saying anything) and we asked for the ketchup, which he eventually brought out. Overall, the tots were not that great. I wouldn't recommend them. Also, my coworker got the mac and cheese after our waiter acted like it was the best thing he's ever tasted. When it came out, she took two bites and sent it back. I took a bite as well and it was not good. In her words, it tasted freezerburned and like it had just been warmed up in a microwave. Nothing special at all. 

I felt like it took awhile for our waiter to come back again. But when he did, my coworker said she wanted dessert, so after he brought the menu and came back, we each ordered one. I got the warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and my coworker got the chocolate cake. These came out relatively quickly, but I was not a fan. I LOVE chocolate chip cookies at restaurants like BJs and Cooper's Hawk. But this one tasted like it was warmed up in a microwave and a TINY scoop of ice cream was put on it. The drizzle they put on top tasted like Hershey's chocolate and caramel sauce; which for the record, I don't mind...but not when I'm in a fine dining establishment and paying over $10 for dessert. The dessert was really not good at all--- and desserts are pretty tough to mess up in my opinion, so I was not pleased. Also, after dessert was served, I was getting tired and it felt like FOREVER for our waiter to come back. Finally, by the time we got our checks, it was 8:45pm--2 hours and 40 mins after we arrived. Ridiculous that we were there that long due to the slow service that night. 

To top it all off, we asked our waiter to split our checked and it was this BIG deal about how they were going to get in trouble if they split checks and how they couldn't do that anymore and how corporate had sent a notification, etc. It honestly didn't make sense to either of us. He said that it was because STK was getting in line with other fine dining establishments where there would only be one check (but up to 4 credit cards can be used). I am honestly still really confused by this. I did think about it and unfortunately all times I've been in a fine dining restaurant, either I am paying for myself and a friend or it was a date and I didn't pay. So I've never had this issue come up before. But all in all, I find that to be a wild inconvenience for your customers, ESPECIALLY the ones like us who are there for work and need separate checks since we work in different cost centers. He did break them for us, which I appreciated (so if anyone at corporate reads this, please know that I am glad he did that and I also find your rule ridiculous and pretentious for business guests like myself). 

All told, $120 spent on a seriously subpar dinner. I would not go back and do not recommend it, especially for guests traveling for work.",2019-06-02 16:53:10

This is place is cool enough on image alone.  If you're a Star Wars fan you will enjoy the atmosphere and feel like you are in the movie.   The quality and price really won't matter for your one time visit.

For everyone else, really this is a 3 star place.  Its got a unique, but very limited menu.  I would say its overpriced, but thats standard for theme parks.   

Order your food up front then seat yourself.   The menu is a little different than your average one as they are trying to stick with the outer space theme.  The palettes are more about presentation than quality, but they are actually not bad.  Theres a few beers on tap.

We ordered tater tots,  corn and lobster mac and cheese for side dishes. The lobster mac and cheese tasted like a cheap,  generic boxed mac and cheese with powdered cheese.

I came early on a Sunday evening and it was practically empty. Very nice ambiance. Very intimate. Great atmosphere. Perfect for a date night or just out with friends, especially for any type of celebration. STK recommends that you ""dress to impress"" so be sure to look nice when you go. 

Bread is my weakness and the bread they start you off with is very tasty. It is topped with some type of butter and comes with this green sauce on the side which surprisingly pairs well with the bread. For my meal I ordered the 20oz bone-in ribeye, the lobster mac and cheese, and the asparagus. My steak was absolutely DELICIOUS! So tender, seasoned very well, and the steak (especially the marbling) looked beautiful lol. The lobster mac and cheese was alright but I was very disappointed in the amount of lobster in my dish, especially since I have seen large lumps of lobster in other yelp pics. For $20+ I shouldn't have to search around for my lobster. I might as well had gotten the regular mac and cheese. The asparagus was pretty good. The  little dash of salt  made it better but still nothing special. For my birthday dessert I had the cookie and ice cream and it was scrumptious! It was so good that even though I was stuffed, I kept eating away at the warm gooey cookie that remained in the small cast iron tray topped with ice cream and caramel! Sheeesh my mouth is watering just thinking about it lol. 

The service here is exceptional. The staff was friendly and the bartender-Cody (ate at the bar) was great.

I never write reviews and bad service really doesn't bother me that much as long as the food is good, but my god, I felt compelled to make an account AS I am eating the chicken because in my 25 years of life I have never seen someone treat a paying customer like this, and I am completely in shock. This is coming from a Chinese person who frequents Hong Kong style cafes, and for those who don't know what I am talking about, let's just say those kinds of cafe are notorious for how rude their staff are.

So the chicken is stored in this glass, heated case. No one came to greet us at the counter or anything, which is completely fine - this seems like a self-service kind of thing and the glass says something like ""take and pay at counter"". While we are still browsing the different flavours, a staff member quickly brushes us aside from the glass case to pop a freshly made batch in. This already felt a bit rude since she kinda just shoved us aside, but we didn't think too much of it. There is a counter next to the glass case, so naturally, we think this is where we pay. We stand at the counter, and the same woman, in a very annoyed tone, points to a different cashier across from the BBQ Chicken counter and just repeats ""cashier, cashier!"" Maybe she doesn't speak English, I don't know, but even in her face, she looked so annoyed that people dared to try and take chicken out of this box and pay for it here. Under the giant glowing sign that says BBQ Chicken. It was just bizarre. 

Her ""work""  was really strange, too, like the area was quite empty at this time, to be honest, but she just kept dashing around the kitchen like she's in a real rush to get more chicken into the box when there was already way more chicken than customers coming in.

Anyway, we find where to pay, and I will also say the cashier where we paid was also MISERABLY rude, but I guess she's not part of this business, it's just where we pay...? I'm really not sure, but I won't go in on her here. We pay the miserable lady, we sit down, and then my friend goes up to the BBQ Counter once again to ask if they have napkins. The chicken lady just says ""no"" rudely and again points elsewhere where we can get napkins.

I am just so shocked at how rude they were for absolutely no reason. I told my friend after we sat down ""it feels like we're begging for food"" and I'm pretty sure even people feeding the homeless are much kinder to their patrons than these people are to paying customers here. 

I'm giving this 2 stars because the chicken was not bad. It's crispy on the outside and (the one we got) had a sweet and spicy sauce over it, while the inside is still really juicy and tender.

It's just the service that deserves all the other stars to be removed. Whoever owns this joint, if you ever see this, I really beg you to look into your staff, maybe give them some basic etiquette lessons or something so they don't treat customers like crap.",2019-12-26 01:20:48

We were hungry for a sit down but quick service meal in Hollywood studios and since this was our first time at Galaxy's Edge, we decided to make a mobile order for this (The cantina was out of reservations). Post Covid, they limit how many people can be in at a time, which is very nice and with the summer heat, they gave full size cups of ice water here, which was greatly appreciated. Anyways, when it comes to quick service food, Disney can be a hit or a miss. We ordered the pot roast ($19), the three pieces of ribs ($17) and the fried chicken ($16). My nephew destroyed the pot roast, which wasn't bad. The ribs were good too, but both plates had the typical theme park flavors, so there's not much of accomplishment with flavors. The fried chicken though, was extremely disappointing. It was like having one giant chicken nugget. It wasn't flavorful, it was dry, and felt like a waste of $16. These meals were not cheap, as with theme parks, anything above a burger, nuggets, and pizza will be higher in price. The meal was a disappointment, as it really wasn't all that special to the Galaxy Edge area.

Then I asked her could she please double check and after waiting several minutes, she came back and said no it's regular cheese. 

I then reiterated that it was my first time there and so could she be sure no cheese, sour cream, or anything else that isn't vegan.  I get to the window and she hands me a crumpled bag. I checked the bag, no fries. She explains not all meals come with fries, but these clearly indicate on your menu that they do. She asks me to wait on the fries and then AS I'M WATCHING puts the fries in the bag with her bare hands, with her hands over top touching the fries. 

She hands me two drinks, one with a cracked lid and the other with the lid that wasn't affixed at all. Both spill in my car as she hands them to me.


After all of these fiascos I get home and all 3 items have cheese. I'm so disgusted with the service, attitude, presentation, and quality of the food. This was my first and last time there and I'm out of 19 dollars I paid for food that i can't eat.

-Some of the meat substitutes are great!
-Quick service
-Beautiful design

Cons:
-Pricey!
-No nutrition info available! :( Hoping they'll change this in the future.
-Most items are covered in various sauces/cheezes that don't add much flavor. They have a dispenser for the Beet Ketchup and the Chipotle Aioli so you're probably better off asking for your items without them and just adding the amount you want!
-Feels a little heavy to have the carb-y patties on buns 
-Desserts were disappointing, and I was tempted by the cupcakes but there were fruit flies attacking the Raspberry Tiramisu!

Pesto Meatball
Tastes like extremely tender meatballs, though with the various sauces this is super messy.

Guac Burger
I skipped the sauces and the sweet potato/quinoa/black bean patty is delicious, though doesn't taste like meat--main flavor is sweet potato. The guac is just okay. Still, I'd get this again.

Old Fashioned Chocolate Chip Cookie

If you want a quick easy meal this is the place to be. Although marketed as a vegan junk food restaurant I feel it is pretty health conscious considering it is 100% plant based and oil is minimally used. They have a great selection of salads which I have tried them all and can say the best are the kale Cesar and spicy Thai tempeh. The pesto meatball sub is a must!! Also their fries are air baked so once again very little oil used. 
I have also tried the muffins and love love them. They are far from dry and always taste fresh. The cinnamon roll which I believe they only serve on the weekends is phenomenal especially the frosting which I can't believe is vegan. Overall if you aren't vegan highly recommend giving this place a try!",2018-12-17 16:41:43

I am extremely disappointed in the communication from your team at the ATL location. Reservations were made more than a month ago and we received no confirmation in writing via text or email about the menu, cancellation policy or expectations for that matter. Less than 48 hours ago we received a message about a $150 minimum per person that applies to reservations starting at 9:00pm. The hostess stated that she could not cancel the reservation without penalty for $100 per person cancellation fee. Are you kidding me? It's very misleading and disappointing that an establishment like STK would treat their customers as such. I just wanted to have a nice dinner with a great ambiance, however now I feel like I'm being bamboozled. I appreciate a great dining experience but do not like being taken advantage of.

In all my years of dining out and being employed in the hospitality industry, this is disgraceful for a place that projects such standards as STK! Next issue was we were a reservation of 8 people we wanted 4 separate checks and we were told we cannot get that!? Seriously!? An 8 top with 4 checks is too hard to process?????????  The server told us we could pay with 4 cards just tell him the amount to charge on each card . Then the manager told my husband that if we use 4 cards each card would be charged the same amount, the bill would basically be split 4 ways. One couple had ordered significantly more than the rest of us so that left us to scramble and find the server so our card would not be charged equally. We had to resort to sending the host the money via cashapp for our estimated totals and having her pay on her card ! Such inconvenience! My husband and I had ate previously so all we ordered was a side salad and decided to add shrimp. We got 6 shrimp each and to our surprise we were charged $40 for the 6 shrimp ONLY! Yes you read right, not for the salad for the SHRIMP! A side salad with added shrimp for almost $50 dollars is absolutely NOT worth it! We did not order a salad as our entree we ordered a side salad!

-Wagyu Flat Iron with the Au Poivre sauce
-6oz Filet 
-Sweet Corn Pudding
-Creamed Spinach

The wagyu flat iron steak was so soft and tender that it melt in every bite. It went really well with the Au Poivre sauce that I got so I definitely recommend this. The mister really liked this filet as well even though it was a bit rare for my liking. The sweet corn pudding was good but maybe a tad too sweet? It was a nice compliment to the savory steaks though. The creamed spinach was very creamy and maybe not enough spinach? 

Also we got the complimentary bread but it did not impress me because it was super salty. Ekkk.

It is a family tradition to go out for Christmas Eve. We rotate restaurants each year and we have always we have had a great experiences all over town, but not tonight. Not our first visit to STK, but for sure our last. Please do yourself a favor and go anywhere else like Chops, Capital Grill, Bone's, McKendrick's, Marcel's, Hal's, The Palm, Rumi's, you name it. 

We waited 45 minutes for oysters. We waited 20 plus minutes on our first round of drinks and then we waited 25 minutes for a refill on a coke. In all three instances we had to follow up on the request by flagging down the server or even another employee because we were not being checked on at all. Food arrived and meals were placed incorrectly, we had to shuffle the plates around. By the way iced tea, coke and lemon-aide are charge per refill even if the glass isn't empty. 

When you spend $600+ on a dinner you expect great service and great food. Unfortunately, tonight we didn't receive either. All of the meat was cooked over the requested temperature. The $75 Delmonico was so overcooked that we brought it to the managers attention.  He examined the plate and of course was quite pleasant and immediately said it would be removed from the bill. I wish that at this point things improved, but flat out the server was terrible, he chose to ignore us. 

We tried to make the best of things because it is a holiday and we wanted to have a great evening, Of course the meal ends and the promised comp was not taken care of, even though the server insisted it had been removed. Again we asked for the manager to come our table. He reviews it, then the bill returns corrected. I can only assume that the server thought because of the wine we would not notice the error. 

STK has a fun, trendy atmosphere that is more like a club than a restaurant. Too bad they missed on every opportunity tonight.",2019-12-25 03:50:05

Maybe I just ordered wrong, but I don't plan to sit in that long-ass fucking line again any time soon so this one paltry review will have to do.  

I ordered the chicken finger combo. The best thing about it was the option to get cheerwine as my soft drink.  Fuck yeah!  Move over Coke, there's a new soda on draft and it's way better than you and Pepsi. (You're still second best in my eyes though.) I think you NC people only like the chicken fingers for nostalgia purposes because what I had was some heavily breaded, straight from the freezer chicken tenders. I think I used to buy the same brand when I had that fryer in my house for a month. I had to let the fryer go after I realized I was eating frozen chicken fingers and curly fries every.single.day. Luckily I was in college and my beer drinking workouts kept me slim. The sides I chose were onion rings and fries.  The fries were ok.  Frozen, but I do love some fried potato, especially when my diet doesn't allow me to eat them very often.  The onion rings were terrible.  Again straight from the freezer onion rings with seriously heavy breading and a teeny onion slice inside every one.  I had flashbacks to the onion rings of my public school youth. Again, you get an option of Cheerwine as your drink, and while I typically always skip the soda option I could never skip Cheerwine. 

Sadly, I didn't get a shake.  Perhaps that would have upped my review a star.  As it stands I was highly disappointed especially with Dynomutt and Daniel hyping it up. You guys *hangs head*.",2014-05-29 19:18:42

I grabbed my free bag of pita chips from the rack (there's a yelp check in offer there), he explained to me how to eat my sandwich, and I was on my way.  Oh, you thought there was only one way to eat a sandwich didn't you?  Silly rabbit!  Nooo, they have special packaging there that allows you to eat without getting it everywhere!  I wasn't a huge fan of the pita chips, there were just alright.  They were homemade, and you could tell, with some of them not being cooked all the way and all.  I got the jalapeno cheddar, and I didn't care for the seasoning.  It was bland.  But if that was the worst part of my meal, bring it!

It looked like the employee put about 3/4c of cheese on my pita. To be called healthy pita with these standards is really a misnomer.

Special shout out to the Seaport district - it is an up and coming Boston neighborhood with lots of construction going on, and beautiful, futuristic glass buildings popping up all around. I kept quoting SpongeBob, saying ""Everything is chrome in the future!"" with regards to the silvery color palette of the surroundings. There are a ton of new stores and restaurants in the area, and we walked by more than a few that I will need to come back and try! 

ANYWAY, back to the review! by CHLOE is a sweet little hidden gem situated on the side of one of these fancy glass buildings. You won't see it from the street, but there is a small sign directing diners toward an alleyway that has everything a twenty something girl could ever want - by CHLOE, a Juice Press, and a SoulCycle. I was kind of in basic heaven (TM), which only increased after walking into the adorable interior of the restaurant. It was bright and clean, with soft lighting, wooden tables, and a shelf full of succulent plants. I felt like such millennial trash and LOVED EVERY SECOND! I saw a lot of people getting post-workout treats after their SoulCycle classes, and I think the continuity of aesthetic between by CHLOE and SC is serendipitous. I wonder if they planned it that way..

The menu is chock full of vegan specialties, from salads to burgers, and even desserts. We each ordered a sandwich and a drink, and then split an order of fries. My Pesto Meatball sub was flavorful, with tender mushroom and veggie (tasted like eggplant?) ""meatballs"", zesty marinara, and a dash of fresh pesto. Yum! Boyfriend got the Guacamole Burger - I insisted on a bite, and it was also tender and flavorful, with a hint of freshness from the guacamole, all piled on a pillowy wheat bun. The fries, however, were less than impressive. I was particularly disappointed because the special diet I am on allows for this kind of French fry (they are made in an ""air fryer"", so there is less oil), and I was ready to indulge. However, the fries were hard and cold. Pretty lame. Luckily, the earthy Beet Ketchup and spicy Chipotle Aioli as dippers made the fries a bit better. As for drinks, my boyfriend thought his lemonade was too sweet, and I was worried that by CHLOE fell into the same trap that ""healthy food"" restaurants find themselves in time and time again - making food too sweet in order to appeal to the masses. I was impressed, however, with the brand of sparkling water they sell, and thought the Elderflower flavor was very good. 

Yes, the food at by CHLOE is super yummy, and when all was said and done, I left feeling satisfied but not stuffed. That being said, this delightful dining experience doesn't come cheap - both of our sandwiches, the fries, and the drink totaled somewhere around $35. For a counter-service restaurant, it was a little steep. But for a treat and an introduction to really great and innovative vegan cooking, our visit to by CHLOE was a wonderful resolution to months of trying to get here to eat!",2017-09-10 05:02:23

I will say I have been to my fair share of the ""it restaurateurs"" so I knew what STK was about and I knew the food would be good based on many of my friend's rave reviews. 

One thing I decided to not think about was putting on a bodycon and some pumps to uphold their dresscode.

Somewhat unexpectedly, we found ourselves in a place called the Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu, my first trip outside of my solar system.  It is a concerning place with Storm Troopers keeping the peace under the direction of a Hondo Ohnaka, a more than scary figure clad in black.  They enforce allegiance to the First Order.

To avoid a passing patrol we ducked into Docking Bay 7 where we came across food service.  Famished, we looked over their offerings.  Tropical alcoholic beverages with names like Takodana Quencher and Surly Sarlacc were tempting, but we must keep our wits sharp this day.  I settled on ordering Batuuan Beef Pot Roast, similar to pot roast back home but with some pasta instead of potatoes, plenty of beef and tender, but the flavor was a little off.

The Bay had an unpolished, a well-used look, seemingly more by design than neglect.  Unfamiliar music played in the background, mostly percussion but without any consistent beat.  The locals who sold us our food were friendly enough, and we had our food quickly.  Relaxing for a short time in Docking Bay 7 was a welcomed oasis.",2019-12-13 02:33:10

The ambiance is very nice. It's definitely a place you can get dressed up and be fancy - very upscale and classy.

This particular time we went to celebrate my birthday. I must say it was an absolute 5 star red carpet treatment all the way, from the time we sat down to the end!

They have valet at the entrance of the restaurant so you can just walk right in and they will take care of your car for you (for a fee - sorry! I don't remember)

They really know how to make you feel special!! We ordered bottles of Moet ($130) and wine ($116 -Yamhill Cuvee Pinot Noir 2014). They both came out with sparklers (like bottle service in the club). 

We started off the meal with an awesome seafood appetizer platter that came with shrimp, oysters, crab claws (a few broken pieces), and various seafood salads. It was all so very delicious.

For the main course, I had the Porterhouse steak ($105). Others had the Delmonico steak ($63), short rib ($29), and 16oz sirloin steak ($45).  Everything is ala carte, so you pick your sides separately. We had lobster mac and cheese ($23), loaded mash potatoes ($14), mac and cheese ($10), roasted cauliflower ($12), and sauteed mushrooms ($12). 

We also had glasses of Stellina di Notte ($12 each). We finished the meal with double expressos ($5), tea ($3) and cappuccino ($5).

For my birthday dessert, I elected warm cookie on a skillet, which by the way also came out lit with a sparkler !! We also had chocolate cake ($5 per slice).

Overall, the experience was very memorable and they went out of their way to make me feel extremely special. The waiter we had was very attentive and service was prompt, with the exception of us waiting to get a table. Although we had a reservation, we still waited almost 30 minutes to be seated for a party of four. That would have probably been a little bit more annoying if I was on a time constraint. However, we were in no hurry and it was also a Saturday night so they were very busy.

So, . . . . are you ready for the grand total??? . . . 
(drum roll pleeeeeease . . . . . ) . . . The damage for this amazing birthday dinner was only a little over a whopping $1000 (plus tip). For this nominal price, you too, can feel like a princess!! 

My only complaint about my birthday celebration, is after dropping all this money, STK CHARGED us for my birthday dessert  That was a tad bit of a surprise . . . Maybe I'm being difficult and I'm asking for too much, but I'd think they give you a $10 dessert after spending that kind of money, but whatever.

Nonetheless, I definitely recommend this place. I was very impressed with the ""show"" they put on for the celebration. Like I said, I've been here many times before, but this topped the other visits. If you want to celebrate and go all out, this is a good place!

We were visiting the Atlanta area and heard good things about STK so figured we would check it out. For starters, we had reservations for 9:15 and weren't seated until 9:45. The ambiance has a club/lounge type vibe. Everyone was dressed like they were going to a club too. We waited patiently but weren't even able to get a drink at the bar because it was so packed. 

When we were finally seated, we were squeezed into a little two seater and our waiter decided to show up 10 min later. We ordered a couple of drinks, the Cowgirl Ribeye, the Delmonico, truffle fries, and Mac n cheese. The restaurant is very dimly lit and everyone had a tea light candle except for us. They brought out the pull apart garlic bread and our entrees and side. All of which were which was just meh. I tried the STK sauce and do not recommend. It is a sweet sauce, not what I expected. The pictures of the food make it look better then it actually tastes. Not bad, but not great. 

At one point, the entire restaurant went dark and the servers came out with sparklers and gave everyone a free premixed shot. No clue what it was but we drank it. I guess that was cool but again, more of a club feel than a restaurant. 

The food was unimpressive and the service left a lot to be desired. If you're looking for a club that serves food than this is the place for you. If you're like me and want a good meal, I'd do some more research because there must be better steakhouses in Atlanta.",2018-10-23 16:52:04

It was as foggy as it gets on a Wednesday afternoon in the good old seaport.

What a supreme location, amid my hunger a quick stroll was really all I could manage. I walked in and noticed how spotless and clean the place was! I was helped by the nicest woman ever, Ada. The entire menu was as appetizing as it gets and an indecisive person as myself really wanted to order everything!! Ada was so kind and helpful and walked me through the best things on the menu. It was then that I saw a sparkly chai eggnog cupcake.... I could not believe my eyes. As if chai eggnog wasn't enough, this cupcake was topped with gold glitter. I added that baby to my order along with a chicken parm and some loaded fries. The food was amazing, the flavors, the texture, everything 10/10. But what really made this experience incredible was talking to Ada. This woman's got it all- the friendly spirit, wonderful eyeliner, the prime recommendations and not only for the menu but even beyond. I got the greatest taki pairing recommendation and I cannot wait to try her suggestions. The food will definitely keep me coming back but Ada's energy brought genuine happiness to my life, that feeling that we as humans are continuously in search of.

I picked the bug out and put it on a napkin and quickly crumpled it up. Feeling nauseated, I knew I would have to walk back to request a refund since they don't have a phone number.  When I got there, I told the cashier about what had occurred, asked for a refund and she asked me to wait for someone to assist.  I asked if they could let their manager know what had happened. The male manager who came over, looked at the cashier and asked where the bug was and if he could see it. He didn't look at me to ask.  Upon hearing that, I let him know that while I thought about bringing the bug back, I decided not too since the thought of it grossed me out and had tossed it into the trash with the napkin.  He tried to tell me that he would issue a refund anyway, but with LevelUp it would take a few days. I confirmed that it was fine with me.

While most people would probably feel okay about this interaction, having gotten a refund, what's the issue? I actually left feeling upset and deflated. The one thing that I take issue with is the lack of care from their management (this manager in particular). Not once did he nor his staff apologize for what had happened. He went about the refund as if it were just a routine part of his day.  There was no effort to make me feel better as a customer for the inconvenience nor was there reassurance that it would not happen again and they would look into their sanitation process.  Maybe he would want to retain a regular? I'm guessing he doesn't care, because it's the vibe I got from his tone and his presence.  Sometimes bad vibes are hard to put into words, but that left more of a bad taste in my mouth.

TBH it kind of pains me to write this review.  I wanted to be a by Chloe fan since I heard about them opening in Seaport a year ago.  When they finally opened, I quickly became a regular and go 2-3 visits per week.  The cashiers know my face and some remember my name.  One of the male cashiers who was recently promoted to a manager, has always treated me with respect as a customer, so they aren't all terrible.  Despite it's high prices and food that sometimes misses the mark, I kept coming back because as a plant-based eater, I was thrilled to have a vegan option nearby.

Shout out to the Dining Out passbook for $30 off, although it was a drop in the bucket compared to the total bill. STK is super easy to find and has $5 valet, which we would have used had we not taken Lyft. 

Stevie Wonder was pumping through the speakers when we walked in, so I knew this was going to be a good experience. The music was amazing. 

We were seated in a cozy booth smack dab in the middle of everything.  Shortly after being seated, we met our wonderful server, Alex. He walked us through all of the specials. He made one of them sound so good that I had to order it. 

I opted for the 6oz wagyu with blackened shrimp and butter poached lobster. OMG. It was outstanding. Hubs had the NY strip and loved his. We chose the truffle parmesan fries and grilled asparagus for sides. While both were tasty, they were barely shareable. A table of 2 needs about 3-4 sides. We were a little disappointed with the portion sizes for the cost of $14. For example, the truffle fries were made of a single potato cut into 6 pieces. We're not cheap by any stretch, but were shocked. We also paid $14 for approximately 10 tiny asparagus. 

We both had an old fashioned, which was just okay. I'd likely opt for a bottle of wine over a mixed drink next time. 

 I saw the donut dessert on the website and fully planned to partake, but I was way too full to even try. 

Alex and the food made it totally worth it. Looking forward to next time.",2019-12-02 02:50:49

The name is misleading a bit as they came out as potato blocks stacked in a cute pyramid. They tasted a bit odd... comparable to a chemical taste and I believe that may have been the fault of the truffle seasoning.
I do wish a dress code was enforced. As someone looking for a bit of upscale and fancy experience, there were a lot more people in day time casual attire than anticipated for an evening dinner.

BBQ Chicken is a famous chain in Korea. Supposedly they changed the flavours slightly for the North American palette.

The instructions are not very clear, so here they are:
If you're ordering the 22 piece bucket, you have to preorder in person at the food court specific cashier. It takes about 30 min so I recommend ordering first before you do your other H Mart shopping. The bucket is $25-26, and you can pick from three combos: golden fried & hot spicy, golden fried & secret sweet, or hot spicy & secret sweet.
If you're just going for the $8-10 small buckets, they come in all the flavours (much more selection than the three). You grab what you want from the shelf and pay at the food court cashier.

Unlike most original flavours, theirs is actually really good. They put seasoning in the batter so it's flavourful.

We picked up a 22 piece bucket for dinner. It was more than enough for me and two guys. We had plenty of leftovers.

The only gripe I had is that they were hella busy on a Friday night and could barely fill the self-serve shelf fast enough, and they chose to fill it before their 22piece preorders so I ended up waiting close to 45 min! They work fast but definitely need even more people working on a busier night. The HMart store manager jumped in and out the kitchen the entire time we were there.",2019-05-06 15:14:44

I ordered an apple martini it was delicious . I was very happy . We loved the bread and ordered our entrees . The sides are shareable, they do not come with your steak entree. 

We tried the recommended Corn pudding and also the Mac and cheese. We were not pleased by the Mac and the corn pudding was a very sweet paella.

Yes I was thoroughly enjoying myself at the new Disneyworld's Hollywood Studios Galaxy's Edge.  My wife on the other hand doesn't believe in the Force or the Jedi... I know right?!?  She did stand in line with me for the Millennium Falcon Smuggler's Run and was my partner pilot!

So after that very cool and fun ride, it was now time to eat and we wandered over to the Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo.  The smuggler outside who was answering our questions was quite entertaining.  I say entertaining because she stayed in character the entire time.  I asked if there was a place I could find a hamburger.  She answered that there might be a place ""off world"", but not here. 

This was Disney so nothing is done half-assed.  The decor and uniforms made you feel as though you were dining in the hangar bay of a food freighter filled with fresh supplies offering an array of exotic dishes from across the galaxy.  There were plenty of places to sit inside the spacious hangar bay, but there is also a rustic outdoor seating area surrounded by the old marketplace.  You can actually see some cool sites if you sit outside like possibly seeing a squad of storm troopers march by.

The menu offered the following entrees:  Smoked Kaadu Pork Ribs, Endorian Fried Chicken Tip-Yip, Surabat Shrimp Noodle Salad, Felucian Kefta Hummus Garden Spread, Roasted Endorian Chicken Salad and Batuuan Beef Pot Roast.  Tammy ordered the Chicken Salad which was 13.99 credits and I tried the pot roast for 18.99 credits.  Credits not dollars.

Presentation on the pot roast was a little more elegant than the chicken salad, but I actually enjoyed the flavor of the chicken better.  The cook on the marinated chicken was spot on.  It was tossed with roasted veggies, mixed greens, quinoa, and sprinkled with pumpkin seeds.  When you finally add the green curry ranch sauce... yom yom yom!

The presentation of my Batuuan pot roast was more appealing than the Endorian Chicken.  The braised beef covered with shredded carrots was carefully rested on a bed of kale, mushrooms, and pasta.  The beef was cook nicely, but the amount of fat and gristle almost made the amount of beef lacking.  The sauteed mushrooms, kale and pasta combination itself was delicious.  We both cleaned our bowls.

We didn't try any dessert, but the hangar offered and Oi-Oi Puff, a raspberry cream puff with passion fruit mousse or a Batuu-Bon, a chocolate cake with mousse in a coffee custard.  Might have to try if I ever get to go back.

Customer service was great.  There was always a crew member walking about cleaning up or offering help.  Their drink menu included a couple of alcoholic beverages as well as a non-alcoholic called Moof Juice.  I almost tried it, but I just wanted to get hydrated.  They keep a water dispenser at the corner where guests can help themselves.  Docking Bay 7 was a fun thematic meal experience and if you're a Star Wars fan like me, it would be even more memorable.  The food was good and the atmosphere even better.  So if you're ever in a galaxy far far away, go visit Docking Bay 7!",2020-02-17 09:09:40

Everything I had was not anything like how I would 'make it at home', which sounds great until you're just wondering what is going on in the kitchen.

It was overly tangy but not like lemon, and the paprika (I get it) just was not balanced with the rest. Also, just don't have a secret menu. Its so unwarrantedly pretentious. Even the 'air fried' (baked??) fries were unimpressive. They're potatoes. What happened? 

I was actually really excited to try 'CHLOE.'

Sprinkled in the midst were couples obviously on second or third dates (weekends are saved for more serious courting, right?)

There's no denying it, people don't come here just to eat.  

Here, the steaks are served with a side of ""should we talk to those girls sitting over there?""

Aside from watching the mating habits of Atlanta unfold right before my eyes, steaks are served with the female appetite in mind.  Even the smallest petite fillet can be split , and sides are huge.  

Favorites include the mac-and-cheese.  The mushroom pot pie tasted a little too earthy for me.  

Surprisingly desserts seem like an afterthought here with a selection limited to a ""birthday cake slice"" and trio of forgettable gelatos.",2012-07-23 19:15:45

My boyfriend made us reservations for Valentine's Day. We of course had high expectations but with both of us in the service industry, we understood that service might be hindered. We arrived and waited a moment for the hostesses to even acknowledge us. We walked in and there was a blonde hostess with one side of her head shaved who seemed to be ""in charge."" She was looking at a screen and seemed to be preoccupied. A few other hostesses returned from seating guests and reported back to the one in charge, neither one of them even acknowledged us. I had to say excuse me to get the blondes attention. We had to wait a only few minutes for our table

Our server was great. I couldn't catch his name cause it was so loud in the restaurant but he had a beard and a mustache that curled up. He greeted us promptly and informed us that he'd be taking all our orders at once and would course it out for us.

My boyfriend ordered Bae's lemonade. He said it was good but nothing too crazy about it. I got their Valentine's Day special cocktail called Love Potion. It had grey goose, muddled strawberries, and a graham cracker crust. It was just ok. It definitely needed a sweetness factor to it since strawberries aren't in season right now. Maybe some simple syrup added to the drink or adding sugar to the graham cracker rim.

We started off with a Caesar salad which was good and large enough to share. I liked how they kept the romaine leaves whole. 

I ordered the bone in filet cooked medium rare with asparagus. On the menu it gives you the option to choose a sauce. Our server didn't ask us what we wanted so we asked him if we got a sauce option and he said yes but if you don't tell him while ordering then he defaults you with their au poivre which was described as like an au jus gravy. I chose the horseradish sauce, however, it didn't taste like horseradish at all. The steak was cooked more rare but I didn't mind at all. I just order medium rare cause most places tend to overlook steak. The steak could've used more seasoning though. For a steakhouse where the cheapest steak is $50, you expect way more. The asparagus was decent but that's hard to mess up.  

My boyfriend ordered the cowgirl ribeye cooked medium with Parmesan fries. His steak came out rare. His first cut into the steak was medium rare so he figured he'd just deal with it instead of sending it back since we had already waited at least 30 minutes for food to arrive. He barely made it halfway into his steak before giving up out of disgust. The closer he got to the bone, the more it looked like his steak had just been seared. I enjoy rare steak but he does not so it definitely ruined his appetite. It's funny cause like I said before, steaks usually come out over cooked, not under. The fries were more like wedges. They weren't bad but, again, it's hard to mess up fried potatoes. 

We notified our server about my boyfriend's steak. He notified his manager who applied a 10% credit to our bill but never came to speak to us which I thought was odd for a high end restaurant. We work at a very casual restaurant where our managers are required to visit tables even for minor issues. If guests are willing to come in and spend at least $50 a person on a meal, the least you could do is make sure they had a great experience. We've decided we probably won't be back. Just not worth the money.",2019-02-15 21:03:08

They removed the two appetizers from the bill since we never received...Thanks but that was your mistake, we still wanted our appetizers! I don't even think the appetizers were ordered.. seemed like the server forgot to put in our order. It was shrugged off like no big deal. We were really wanting the crab cakes and calamari.

I ordered dessert and there was no candle or sparkler and the dessert was placed at the edge of the table not even in front of us and walked away.

The steak 14 or 16 oz Delmonico, Medium Rare.  Wasn't a perfect medium rare little closer to medium but close enough to pass.  Great sear to the outside and nice tender cut.  I'd give it about 3.5 out 5.

The sides were for the most part the star of the show.  Had cauliflower, Mac and cheese, truffle and Parmesan fries, and corn pudding.  I'd give the sides a 4.5 out of 5.

Server and service was excellent; very warm, knowledgeable, and kept the meal pace up nicely.

The atmosphere was very nice except for one little issue that did not appeal to me.  So, the interior was clean, good lighting and finally good music.  The issue was the music was so loud that it was hard to keep conversation.  Not to mention it was as if there was a subwoofer under our booth.  I mean seriously the booth was vibrating every time the bass hit!  So I'd rate it a 2 out 5

First things first, I was happily surprise to find that despite being in the middle of midtown, STK has $5 valet which is a steal in the city! Especially when a couple blocks up, it said $15 parking. Great deal and the attendants were nice and helpful. 

My friend requested a private room for her birthday dinner. There was about 20 or so guest among four tables in the room and we were designated 3 waiters for the occasion, all of whom were pleasant and attentive despite dealing with a large group. The decor and vibe is super modern upscale but inviting and warm with fun music playing constantly. 

The food was pretty good. Given in family style, each table had two sets of salad, 3 options of meat (steak, salmon, chicken), 4 options of sides (Mac and cheese, truffle fries, mashed potatoes, & asparagus), and 3 options of dessert (banana pudding, chocolate cake, & cheesecake). Due to the family style serving and the passing around the food and I'm sure having to cook everything, nothing was super warm but everything was seasoned well and prepared and served perfectly. Everyone in our group left happy with full bellies and my friend seriously had a great birthday!

I've been to STK in both New York and Las Vegas...both were absolutely a 4-5 star experience, so I was admittedly disappointed by my evening at the Atlanta location.

First off, we had a reservation at 7pm on Saturday night.  Admittedly, we didn't leave enough time to accommodate for the I-85 bridge collapse traffic, so we called to let them know we were running 20 minutes late.  The response of the woman who answered the phone was that their policy was to hold the table for 15 minutes (totally get it, we were running late and it was our fault).  She proceeded to tell us that they were just really busy that night and might not be able to accommodate us beyond the 15 minute mark.  Aside from her slightly snooty tone on the phone, I totally understood their policy.  We decided to just go anyway and whenever they could accommodate us, we would wait and have a drink at the bar.  That was all fine until we walked in and the restaurant was MAYBE 60% full (and there wasn't one time that evening where all of the tables were full during the whole time we sat there).  Seriously, woman on the phone???  Anyway, they were extremely pleasant once we walked in and seated us very promptly and politely.  So that was our first ""hit or miss"" experience.

Second hit or miss was on the drinks.  The big hit was the Cucumber Stiletto and the All-Nighter.  Highly recommend.  The miss was the Slight City (there was so much Raspberry brandy in there it was really terrible) and the Skinny Dipper.  Both were really sweet drinks to the point where they were just not even worth it to drink and I politely asked for a different drink.

Third hit or miss was the food.  Thankfully the hit was the steak.  Absolutely delicious!  The miss was the Chimichurri sauce.  It was all oil with a LITTLE chimichurri (see my posted pic).  I obviously didn't want oil with my steak so the waiter brought me a better one.  Another hit was the Mac & Cheese, which was nicely browned on the top...while the miss was the side of Brussels Sprouts that was super sweet and kind of chewy.  The next hit and miss was the dozen oysters.  I'm all about paying $36 for oysters, but when they aren't properly cleaned and there are pieces of the outside of the oyster actually inside the oyster, it was a little sloppy and unexpected when you're in a high-end restaurant.

Fourth hit or miss was the service.  Our waiter was clearly going through the motions of just getting us what we needed.  He wasn't mean or overly nice...like literally just saying you want steak, I will put the order in the computer and a food runner will bring you steak.  By mid-meal, there were just so many hit or misses that when the manager came over and asked us how everything was going, I literally told him we had a couple of hits and misses, but the waiter was correcting all the misses.  He said OK and then walked away like he really didn't care.  Wouldn't you want to know what was going wrong???  At that point my assumption was no because you really don't care.

On top of that, there was a large prom party upstairs, which we knew when we saw 60 teenagers come in wearing formal wear and my boyfriend overheard a waiter tell another staff member that ""it's a sh*t show up there right now"".  Funny but inappropriate.

After having great experiences at other STKs, and after speaking so highly of this restaurant to my friends when we decided to go to the Atlanta location, I was absolutely disappointed with my visit.

They have burgers and sandwiches, pasta, salads, brunch, smoothies, desserts, and even snacks for your furry animals! For a vegan restaurant, the food is pretty innovative and tasty. 

I ordered the classic burger and air baked fries. I also got a few bites of my friends' pancakes and guacamole burger. The patty for the burger is a tempeh, lentil, chia, and walnut base. I liked that it was grilled so it tasted charred. However, I didn't like the consistency of it. It was also a little dry. I recommend getting the chipotle aioli and beets ketchup sauce from the condiment section to enhance the burger! The fries were also a bit dry and hard to bite into. But I like that it was seasoned well. The pancakes were definitely the star of the show. It was light and fluffy and was delicious with the butter and syrup.

Unlike it's competition, which is more laid back and personally, has better options, STK throws the word hipster in your face with a slap in the face of over priced designer clothes, bad faux hawks and men with side bangs.

Everything we tried was prepared well - from flavor profiles that were interesting but not overwhelming to a perfectly prepared filet.  STK is very solid - nothing too creative or foodie, just really good food prepared well.

We started with the table bread - delicious!!!  We tried two salads, their take on a wedge and a fennel and arugula salad.  Both were well prepared - fennel thinly shaved and the wedge not over dressed.  We then had the seafood dish - crab, shrimp, ceviche, clams - delicious!  I had a 6oz filet with a side of STK sauce and my dining partner had the lobster mac&cheese.  The beef was perfect - not too salty and seasoned in a way that brought out the flavors of the meat.

In the time it took to do all this, he could have found me a seat. Once again the restaurant is fairly empty and still was as I finished my dinner. This left a bitter taste!

My 2nd visit yesterday wasn't any better. I wanted a good burger and it came out bland.i was really upset cause I wanted a good burger so I ended up going to the Vortex in Midtown.

I paid and realized the change wasn't correct so I asked for the remaining change. 
After a short wait, a girl came out from the kitchen with a paper bag of tater tots. I knew right away she had no idea of what I wanted because it should come with a plate so they can put the sour cream and salsa on top.
I explained to her once again what I wanted but still she could not make it right. another girl came and said she knew what I meant and then she went into the kitchen and came out with something that's not I wanted again.

My only gripe was the preferential treatment my neighbors received. The kitchen was running behind (I get it, the place was pretty full for a Monday and was likely staffed to support that load of customers, while call-ins for kitchen staff is fairly unreliable).  

I ordered in immediate sequential order with my two neighboring tables and we all sat awaiting our food for the same extended period of time. Like any professional front-house manager, he approached our group of tables and offered his condolences for the wait time to the two neighboring tables, but ignored me. 

Overhearing the conversations the waitstaff and management were having with my neighbors, I knew they were being compensated for their above-normal wait time. 

As the food arrived, I spent the next 10 minutes enjoying the food to the sound of the resident DJ mixing Top 40 with the gripes and complaints of my two neighboring tables. I sat in silence and enjoyed my meal.

I did not receive a time-comp for the long wait that my neighbors enjoyed, nor was I privy to a visit with the manager.

The restaurant itself was a very trendy environment with over-the-top beautiful decor.  The DJ spinning in the corner - behind a wall, but there nonetheless - made the mood light and fun.  

However, once we were seated, our waiter was unfocused and completely unprofessional.    He literally walked away from our table in the middle of us ordering with a ""be right back"" yelled over his shoulder.  He kept saying ""yeah man"" to us, a table of two women, and was much more focused on chasing the 20-some scantily clad women there than making sure we had a glass of $15 wine.  

I ordered my steak ""Pittsburgh rare"" which he promised they could do - they didn't and it came out ice cold, not grilled/seared like a Pittsburgh Rare, but at least the meat itself was rare.  When I complained, he asked if I still wanted to eat it and didn't offer to take it away.  The mac n cheese was way too salty and the truffle fries lackluster.  If you want really good steak, unfortunately, this isn't your place. 

Finally, for a really expensive ($250 for two people) meal, the restaurant offers no coziness or privacy as all the booths face out toward each other.  The tiny two-person booth is uncomfortable if you are there with a friend or business associate, because you are sitting side-by-side in a small, half-circluar booth.  It's definitely not appropriate for a business meal or a private conversation.   If  you are going to the club afterwards, it's a better place for you.

Now let's talk about attire, before going I visited their website online and they require the women to wear heels. I was a little skeptical of this being true, but the theme was pretty consistent with every woman I saw in the restaurant. Secondly, I believe they have a no jeans policy. As the couple in front of me for turned around for wearing them. (This is expected of course) 

Now on to the food. I really enjoyed my meal and my tab was definitely lower than what I expected. However, I can see this place getting pricey after going with a man as he may prefer the larger portion of steak and more sides, which is definitely more money. The dessert is very good! We have the orange cheesecake, which is something I would never usually try but it ended up being quite delicious! 

Overall it's definitely a must try, I give it 4 stars only because I've witnessed high end restaurants serve larger portions for the same amount of money. Plus I don't feel like it would be very filling for a man.",2016-06-28 06:45:42

We waited 20mins for a steak and it came out well done. We waited for our server to come. He didn't say anything but motioned for the manager to come over. I explained to the manager that I asked for medium and this was my second steak. I showed and asked if it was medium and he said definitely not.

My parents and I recently binge watched the Netflix show, Crash Landing On You. If you're familiar with K-Dramas, then you know that this is one of the most popular shows in Korea right now. In the show, the Korean chicken restaurant BBQ Chicken makes frequent appearances, and after this show was released, the restaurant chain became even more popular. 

Fast forward to a few days ago, my parents and I were craving fried chicken and decided to pick up from this spot located in the corner of H Mart. Their menu consists of a variety of different flavours, chicken combos, and more. We decided to get the 22 piece golden & hot spicy fried chicken box. For $24.99 I thought this was a pretty good deal. 

Once we got home, we devoured the chicken. I personally thought it was seasoned and flavoured really well. The hot and spicy was still perfectly crispy even though it was covered in sauce. It never once felt soggy. My parents and I loved everything about it. 

It wasn't till after our dinner and looking at the flyer that was given to us, that we realized that we had just eaten from the same fried chicken shop as the one in Crash Landing On You.

Upon being seated (8:15PM) there was a nice ambiance. It took nearly an hour for our order to be taken (table of 12). Food came fairly quickly, 20ish minutes. Portions are RIDICULOUSLY SMALL, I'm talking a 4 oz salmon. I had the short rib with jalepeno cheddar grits. Grits were good on their on but weird with the short rib which was over salted but a fair portion. The mac and cheese was the best thing on the menu (sampled a lot of things from other's plates and was completely underwhelmed). For these prices take your wallet to Capitalle Grill, American Cut, etc. Fast forward to a fiasco with the check (they do not split checks at all) by 10:15PM we were still waiting for the waiter to bring the birthday cake. He did not offer us a dessert menu but someone in our party talked with him to make sure it was coming and he said yes. By 10:30 (when they closed) we still had no cake our candles and the waiter said it wasn't coming. So as to not ruin the singing of the birthday song someone in our party bought everyone shots and 10 minutes later the waiter brought it out with a sparkler. Not what the birthday girl called about or was reassured of. When the manager asked how the evening was we were frank about the issues and her only response was well you got the shots right? Tuh. HARD PASS on this place.",2019-04-06 00:11:55

The good:
- Music

The bad: everything else.
1) We made reservations at 8:30 on a Saturday night. We were seated promptly by a hostess. She was nice. However her outfit was some form of lingerie. Not tasteful at all. 

2) Our server finally came to the table, his name was Val. His personality was very lackluster. It was my first time dining here so naturally I ask what's good? He said um steak. Well duh. What else, what kind? He did not elaborate on the menu or give recommendations. Before we even told him our order he informed us we have to order two sides if we are only getting an appetizer. I am far from cheap but what the actual fuck STK. I don't know what kind of clientele you usually have but I just think it's weird that you have that rule. 

3) I ordered the Lemon Drop Martini. It literally tasted like watered down minute maid. So disgusting. I sent it back and opted for ros√©. 

4) The bread was not good and the green dipping sauce did not complement it at all. It tasted like onion flavour olive oil. And on top of that it stained my top. 

5) I ordered shrimp cocktail appetizer, filet with blue butter, lobster mac & cheese, and tried some creamed spinach. The shrimp cocktail was alright. The filet was cooked to temperature medium but the blue butter sauce was nasty. It had a weird consistency and tasted kinda like tartar sauce. Creamed spinach was not good. The lobster mac & cheese was not bad but not quite good either. 

6) Not even 10 minutes into trying to enjoy our meal Val comes over with a menu and asks if we want dessert. We all kinda just stared at him like are you serious we literally just got our entrees. Then the busser comes to our table twice trying to clear the crab legs after my friend clearly said she was still working on them.

7) The ""raw bar"" plate that the cold seafood is served on is literally a mess. The ice was melted and was leaking everywhere. 

I was extremely underwhelmed. This place is overpriced. I'm curious to see how long they will last. The crowd was odd, the bar was empty and i just got an overall weird vibe from this place. I swear people just come here to take pictures in the bathroom. It's all hype!!!!!

I almost forgot when I pulled up the valet was no where to be found so I had to park in the garage. I had to pay $12 to get out. Needless to say I was heated. 

If you want a real steakhouse and dining experience go to Chops in Buckhead. Please do not come here. I'm so sad I wasted my money :(",2017-12-24 05:19:38

Even though it was my first time trying it last Friday, I had an idea of what it would be - which is to say, a way to satisfy my need for a greasy, non-fancy cheap & tasty burger. While the food was cheap enough, the quality did not meet expectations. I would go for a McD's burger any day over this tasteless, small excuse of a patty. The fries were ok albeit a bit soggy. The oreo milkshakes, the thing they are famous for with their endless variety of mix and match choices, tasted like straight-up flavorless sugar. It was so thick I'm not sure why they gave me a straw. I also don't understand why it took 15 minutes to prepare as they didn't seem particularly busy. I ended up finishing a little over half before I decided the sugar high wasn't worth what I was drinking.

But my body, my body's telling me yes...
Baby, I don't want to hurt nobody...
But there is something that I must confess!""

My first confession: Steak tastes better when a DJ is playing '90s era R&B songs in the background. 

My second confession: And of course, I don't see nothing wrong with little bump and grind, baby.

Double negative aside, I really enjoyed STK. When I walked in STK in Atlanta for a client dinner on a drizzly October night, I was impressed with the ambiance featuring beautiful hostesses, gorgeous full bar, and dim lighting. But I was most impressed by the DJ in the corner. He was setting the mood in with R. Kelly (and would soon follow with other classic '90s era panty droppers).

My client is a woman of very high taste. And I knew good music and my snazzy suit wasn't going to close the deal. For this business dinner to be a success I was going to need some good drinks, great service, and amazing food. Luckily for me, STK delivered on all three. 

""How did you get in...
Nobody's supposed to be here...
I've tried that love thing for the last time...
My heart says no, no...
Nobody's supposed to be here...
But you came along and changed my mind!""

Yeah, I'm not sure how it happened, but as Deborah Cox was playing in the background an Old Fashioned ended up in front me. I think my client ordered it for me when I wasn't paying attention. It was strong and delicious. She seemed really happy with her wine. The server made really great recommendations on drinks and we trusted her recommendations on the food as well. The business center was just getting started and so was the DJ.

""I'll always think of you...
Inside of my private thoughts...
I can imagine you...
Touching my private parts...
With just the thought of you...
I can't help but touch myself...
That's why I want you so bad!""

As the DJ played Toni Braxton, the appetizers came out and were delicious. But my bone in filet mignon was really good. I wanted to lather it all over my body and make love to it. That's how damn good it was.

""Aaahh, aaahh, aaahh
It feels good...yeah
It feels good...
Oh, it feels good...
It feels good...
sure feels good to me!""

Tony! Toni! Ton√©! Drink! Drink! Drink!

""Long as you know that...
I could have any man I want to...
Baby that's actual and factual...
But still I choose you to be with me...
And work on me so you better not mess it up!""

TLC was on in the background and I was a few strong and delicious cocktails in. I could sense the client liked what I had to say and was going to give me her business. I just didn't want to mess it up.

""If you're horny let's do it, ride it, my pony...
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it!""

Ginuwine was a nice choice by the DJ. Dessert was good. It was at the restaurant. I just don't mix business with pleasure. But I do mix steak with '90s era R&B music. 

Good times.",2017-01-26 00:10:12

Second, she notice my bf and I were speaking Spanish and she wished us happy New Years in Spanish, so appreciated. 

Now to the actual restaurant. We both got the Wagyu beef, a first time for both of us. I got medium rare and my bf got medium (cause he is a N00b with steak). Trust me, medium rare is the way to go-they know what they are doing. The steak was juicy and tender. I chose a sauce, but it was unnecessary. For dessert I got the trio- a dessert, port, and espresso for a pretty reasonable price ($18 at the time of posting). I was able to feed my sweet tooth, get a buzz going, and get a wake up before dancing the new year in. 

Overall I would recommend this place. Service and food were amazing! Just make sure you make a reservation to minimize waiting as this place is poppin!

Edit: a lot of people are talking about steak ""inconsistency"". They state on the menu that they cannot guarantee steak over medium well.

The Mac and cheese was also just okay. The creamed corn, the only dish my server was enthusiastic about, was fine.

We parked across the street for $10 before noticing that the valet was only $5 (so...next time for sure). We were seated almost immediately after checking in and sitting briefly under a nicely hidden DJ booth in the corner of the bar lobby.
The music was great, the energy was fantastic and the food was excellent.
We both chose the Caesar salad. I had the Shake Your Honey Maker for a cocktail. I had the 8 oz Wagyu Filet w/ Alaskan King Crab while my friend enjoyed the 6 oz with Blue Butte (that she let me tru and I must say that is was EXCELLENT, I'd definitely Talk to you later be ext time). We both ordered one side disk; with me choosing the Creamed Spinach and her chooSing the Corn Pudding. 
Our order did run a little behind but the manager on the floor came over and informed us that our food was coming right out, but that the Alaskan King CRaB is cooked to orrery and that is what was taking a long time. And shortly thereafter, it did come right out.
It was my birthday and I'm so glad that I chose to spend it at STK. Everything was delicious (the steak literally melts in your mouth), the service was great and the vibe was amazing. I would definitely come back again.",2020-01-20 23:01:07

I also loved all of the variety of sides -- we tried the creamed corn, creamed Spinach, roasted cauliflower and lobster Mac and cheese. My favorite item overall was the Mac and cheese. It was rich and delicious, the pasta was cooked perfectly and with was amply full of crab.

No one received a confirmation email so when we called- as we're on limited time with our lunch hour- we were told that it was being worked on and would be enough route soon. That's fine by us, were super excited to not leave the office in the crummy weather.  So after almost an hour of no food, we call again and are told our order doesn't exist? Seriously? I won't pretend that I know the complexities of their online ordering system for group orders, but I find it suspicious that it was able to process every single credit card on the group order- we we could all see on our individual bank or credit card accounts- but that our order (which our leader had an order number for) didn't exist. 

At this point, all we want are some sweet carby goodness and we attempt to fix the situation with Gene- the manager- except that his only solution was the we reorder, pay AGAIN, and could contact customer service about receiving a refund.

Really. 

At this point, really the only option that I, and the rest of the team (many of whom have now missed their lunch hour) think is appropriate is that the order be comped- a thought that is supported by the fact that many of us have worked in food service and are confident that our pat leaders would have done. Gene refused to entertain any Alternate solutions we came up with and informed us that he simply did not care if he lost not only the business of our department, but of our entire company. Wow.

The restaurant is chic and sexy. Smaller than I imagined but very nice. Valet was professional and I was greeted with smiles.

The drinks were delicious and the waitress was knowledgeable.  He and I decided to review food pics on Yelp prior to ordering. We took our time ordering so that we could catch up. I think our waitress was a little irritated because we didn't order entrees until 2 hours after being seated. Sorry, but the drinks, music (80's and 90's playlist) and appetizer was so good we lost track of the time.  The entrees and dessert was great also.

I wish I had been aware they were taking the dining plan at Docking Bay 7 and we would have scheduled a meal there (or two!) during our trip.

Everything was great aside from the chicken. Neither of us really seemed to care for it much. The broccolini was my favorite. It was seasoned so wonderfully and it was nice and crispy almost! Highly recommend it. 

We also ordered the Batuu Bon for dessert at the suggestion of a cast member. The Batuu Bon is straight up delicious!!! It was easily my favorite dessert of our entire two week vacation.  It's a chocolate cake with white chocolate inside as well as a coffee custard that is out of this world. Totally been daydreaming of this dessert. It's wonderful and all the flavors combined is incredible and just something completely different than what I've ever had before! I asked a cast member what the yellow cream is off to the side and she didn't know but my best guess is a mango flavor? Whatever it is, it is so wonderful and adds a lot to the overall taste. 

I highly recommend eating here. The atmosphere was great and definitely themed just right. I loved the variety of tables and chairs here. I even saw some outdoor seating.

I came here on a date for dinner on a Friday night. I wish we only stopped in for drinks that probably would have been an okay experience.

I got the 18oz dry aged Kansas City steak ($78) medium rare. My first 2 bites were okay so did not say anything to the waiter when he asked how things came out cause it was frankly okay and cooked to my liking.. However as I got further along the steak it got tougher and tougher.. Kansas City cut is a New York strip steak aka top sirloin. I don't think I've ever had a sirloin with a bone. Welp this one had a bone and I should have said something, but I was already half way through my steak :(
I've never had any difficulty finishing a steak from petite filet mignon medallions to 30oz tomahawks. This steak on the other hand became a chore for me. If I had a dog I wouldn't have even bothered getting close to the bone lol would have just boxed it up and gave it to the pooch.

My date got the market fish ($60) which was the snapper it was served over some potato gnocci. The first was slightly overcook so a bit dry aside from the sauce, but the gnocci was good. We were both rather mehhh about our meals despite being hungry. I didn't really want to put a damper during our date that dinner sucked so didn't lament long there.. Afterwards we both agreed it was awful and we stopped by Cafe Intermezzo to wash out the bad taste with some great cheesecake!

The ambiance is dark, loud (there's a DJ), and classy. There's a lounge waiting area and or bar area when you walk in. The best thing we had there were the complimentary bread rolls topped with a garlic, blue cheese butter that was great. Even the bread didn't come out oven hot to our table :/

I came here with a friend who wanted to eat vegan, and we'd heard of by CHLOE before. She got the Guac burger + fries + drink combo ($13.95), and I went for their Kale Caesar salad + drink (watermelon mint lemonade) ($10.95+ $3.50). I was a little cautious about ordering a Kale salad since I'm aware that you should eat it organic when possible (due to high pesticide content). I asked the person at the register whether they use organic ingredients and she said, ""Yes, everything here is organic, vegan, and local"". 

But alas, I was not dazzled by the quality or flavor profile of the salad-- some of the greens were yellowy (aka not very fresh), some leaves were clearly nommed on by bugs (holes), and I honestly felt like they didn't bother to wash the greens before serving. It looks like a big portion for a salad in a bowl, but containing 90% mostly meh salad greens + 10% meh toppings (shiitake ""bacon"": air-dried or crispy-baked soy-sauce flavored mushrooms that didn't taste all that great or add much flavor; avocado; maple croutons, etc.) I have had much better salads elsewhere including self-made at home. 

The lemonade was good, and I notice they use sustainable paper straws which is considerate but they soaked up liquid and became quickly flimsy. 

I had to follow up on by CHLOE's website about the organic bit to which they say (see below **whenever possible**; hence unsure about the ""top quality"" of ingredients used):

There was no walking us threw the menu or recommendations . The service then took our drinks orders( which she brought the wrong drinks back) then proceeded to take our food orders.

I order the braised short ribs and heiort covert. I ask the server if I could sub mash for the jalape√±o grits. Which I was told no..Mash for grits ( really couldn't understand how i wasn't able to sub). It wasn't like I was asking for the lobster Mac, which I definitely would have understood no sub. But I still got it with the grits because I was really in the mode for short ribs. Needless to say, I scarp the grits in the corner of my plate and ate the short ribs (which the sauce look dry).The heiort covert were good, but came out cold..When the serve came and check on us, I told her about it and she said ok. But that's all that was done. Then she never came back to check on us again. I then ask the server assistant, if he could get our server so we could get our check. Which I did see him tell her, but still took 15 mins before we got the check. Which she had another server bring it to us. I paid the full bill ($174.89 for two people)and left a tip, because the server assistant was good. Which I didn't want him to lose money because the lack of attention from the server.

First time at STK, this was a business dinner. We had an 830p reservation but had to wait 20 mins for seating. We wanted outdoor because Covid, but it rained and the seating was wet so they put everyone inside. We were seated with an instruction to be done in 90 minutes. While there is plexiglass between each table, the tables are all very close together and it's a high traffic area throughout. 

We were surprised that the music was so loud, but I assume it becomes more of a nightclub atmosphere on Saturday night so we decided to grin and bear it. 

Our booth seat was a half moon which is great for intimacy or date night, but horrible for business. Especially with the small round table which was completely exposed to waiters and guests passing by. 

We decided to talk and eat with our masks on the entire time. We chose flat Fiji water which one guy initially served but that our waitress kept opening and refilling (all bare handed). Bread was served, pretty but taste was just ok. $20 Caesar salads were lacking but the croutons were great. My 8 oz filet with peppercorn and lobster tail ($69) were fine, however I ordered it medium and it was served medium rare. My colleague ordered a NY strip ($61) and said it was also fine. We both felt the peppercorn topping was the best part. We shared mashed potatoes which were good and creamy, as well as creamy spinach which was mush! Finally I orders a mocktail which was nice to find on the menu and quite tasty. 

We wrapped up dinner and signed our $266 check including 20% tip (because despite the mediocrity, Covid). I chose email for the receipt only to find today that it was not even our check! Fortunately when I calculated the costs for our items, they came out to only $5 dollars difference, so not worth calling for a refund and reprocessing. 

The best part is that it was walking distance to my co-op and the waitress was kind. That said, I would not return again.",2020-12-13 17:31:58

MAC N CHEESE - Love the medium sized shells; the whipped cashew and sweet-potato sauce is a bit sweet but overall its a good dupe for the real thing. The winner here are the ""bacon"" shiitake mushroom bits - thin, crispy & smoky - nice balance to add some savoriness to the slightly sweet base.

-Some of the meat substitutes are great!
-Quick service
-Beautiful design

Cons:
-Pricey!
-No nutrition info available! :( Hoping they'll change this in the future.
-Most items are covered in various sauces/cheezes that don't add much flavor. They have a dispenser for the Beet Ketchup and the Chipotle Aioli so you're probably better off asking for your items without them and just adding the amount you want!
-Feels a little heavy to have the carb-y patties on buns
-Desserts were disappointing, and I was tempted by the cupcakes but there were fruit flies attacking the Raspberry Tiramisu!

Pesto Meatball
Tastes like extremely tender meatballs, though with the various sauces this is super messy.

Guac Burger
I skipped the sauces and the sweet potato/quinoa/black bean patty is delicious, though doesn't taste like meat--main flavor is sweet potato. The guac is just okay. Still, I'd get this again.

Chicky Chicky Parm Parm
Really good faux chicken parm on a potato bun. Would definitely get this again. 

Double Chocolate Cookie
Crispy cocoa-y cookie with chocolate chips. Although I prefer softer cookies, this is the best dessert I've had here and I'd get it again!

Old Fashioned Chocolate Chip Cookie
Chewy, not soft. Has nuts. Not memorable.

We were told that the sides were not family portions, so we ordered two. Although they were not as large as family portions, it was ample for sharing between two people. If there was a weakness in the food, the sides would have been it: asparagus and mashed potatoes were a little bland. Also ordered the raw oysters: superb! Cocktails were great as well. Ginger mojito is the way to go. Great ambience: low lighting, intimate seating for couples, and dj was playing a lot of 70s-90s old school r&b.

Drinks: Very strong! And expensive! And one of a kind!

Food: I had the shrimp pasta and I asked to add crab meat to it and honestly, the amount of crab meat I was charged for, I was so hurt!! They gave me crumbs and charged me $15 for it. The drinks had me tipsy but I wasn't that drunk that I wouldn't have also noticed my shrimp was very chewy (over cooked) smh but the pasta sauce was really good! Now the free range chicken my fianc√© had took longer to come out due to the chef burning it, and once it came out, the inside of the chicken was pink almost red.

When I arrived at the drive through the line wrapped around the curve into the Target parking lot.

It took 19 minutes to get to the speaker for ordering.  The speaker audio quality was clear and easy to understand the server.

It took an additional eleven minutes to move to the window and receive my food. The server at the window was friendly.

I ordered the Beyond vegan avocado taco combo which included two tacos and a side of fries and a large macho drink of Diet Coke. 

I am a part time vegan and will eat some dairy, eggs and seafood. I bring this point up because one of my tacos had real cheese sprinkled on it while the other didn't. No big deal for me but a potential deal breaker for hard core vegans. I suspect that it was an accident due to the heavy volume of patrons and multiple third party delivery service workers overwhelming the staff.  

The Beyond plant based filling was medium spicy and the texture was almost like a pur√©e- I would have preferred it to be more chunky. The shredded lettuce and tomato added some fresh crunch as well as the crunchy taco shell.  Every picture on the menu, website and app clearly showed three generous slices of avocado on each taco however mine arrived with one thin disappointing slice of avocado on each taco. Overall the tacos were tasty but would have been better with additional avocado as shown on all visual representations of the meal.

The large macho size fries were hot and delicious.

Mark ordered two of the spicy jack cheese chicken quesadillas. He said that they were delicious.

We all know that the current virus situation is increasing drive through and carry out business so they should have staffed to accommodate the large volume of patrons. Thirty minutes waiting for food would normally result in a lower rating however I was happy to just be out of the house and didn't mind the wait.  Also, the food should match the pictures.

I give this chain credit for offering a significant number of vegan and vegetarian options - dietary items that do not perpetuate cruelty to animals and damage to the planet. I also appreciate that all items were packaged in paper based packaging with the exception of the drinks.  Restaurants that pack food in styrofoam containers are my pet peeve.

The first time I had it, I tried the kids meal version of Endorian Fried Chicken Tip Yip. The portion was perfect for me (my friends and I were going to Epcot Food and Wine right after so I didn't want to get too full). Drank the Surely Sorlac and it's surely amazing! I tried one of my friends' desserts which I forgot the name of, but it was a pretty ball of mousse cake.

Second time I came here was with my boyfriend and it was our first meal of the day. We also planned to go to Epcot Flower and Garden so we shared to make room for the festival foods. We got the Smoked Kaadu Pork Ribs. Came out with 6 ribs that was so meaty and fell off the bone. The pickled cabbage was so good, the acidity complimented the BBQ sauce. And the blueberry corn muffin was nice and dense; my boyfriend was pleased. He got the Takodana Quench. The drink was really good, but I think I still like my Surely Sorlac more. We got that mousse cake ball dessert, again I forget the name. 

I know Disney food can be pretty pricey. Heck our ribs was like $18 or something. But for what it's worth, it was a good value meal to share. I was pretty content considering we had planned to eat more in an hour or two.

We actually weren't even going to Del Taco.  We were on the way to Target, but lunch on a Saturday afternoon was enough to have us stop in for a couple of tacos. 

Having low expectations, we ordered the following:

2 for $3 tacos 
Impossible taco ($2.49)
chicken quesadilla snacker ($1)
Pico (on the house)

The 2 for $3 del taco is for turkey, and if you want hard shells, which we both did, it's 2 for $3.77, but man, the turkey is worth it!  These hard shell turkey tacos are delicious, highly flavorful with the ground turkey meat! They're topped with shredded cheese, lettuce and diced tomato, which some may say is too much, but it adds to the bite.  Sauces are on the table.  For me, 'medium' sauce was mild, and 'Hot' was medium, but everyone has their spice level so keep that in mind before you lay sauces down on your food.

The chicken quesadilla snacker, for a buck is pretty good!  On this is cheese and grilled chicken chunks.  The flavor wasn't bad at all, and the added pico as well as taco sauce turned a pretty good into a really good.  Nice value!

I wanted to give their impossible taco a try with a hard shell.  It came prepped just like the turkey hard shell taco, i.e. cheese, lettuce and tomato diced and on top.  Here's the thing...while i've had impossible burgers, which had consistency of a ground patty, the impossible ""meat"" of this taco did not have the consistency of ground beef or turkey.  In fact it felt and looked like a bean paste with little in the way of texture.  The flavor of it was okay to us, and sadly, I don't think either of us would order this one again, especially at its price point.

The interior here is pretty open, bright and clean, with a fair amount of seating.  Parking is also not a problem, although the lots are not connected. Translated, if you park at the lot closest to the drive thru window, you'll have to walk over the grass divider to get to the entrance, whereas the opposing lot leads to both the front door and side door entrance.  Parking in general is never going to be an issue, as this Del Taco sits on the foot print of Target, and there'll be spots to grab if the lots are full.

Again, we came in with zero expectations with Del Taco, and left very surprised....so much so we almost came back the next day for lunch again!  If you want very flavorful food that tastes fresh and all for a great deal, you should check Del Taco out!",2020-02-14 02:54:15

We unloaded everything which was all wrapped and boxed and stuck everything in the fridge for Christmas Day.  Fast forward, it is Christmas Day and I go start to prep the dinner and realize...they only gave us 1 order...so now for Christmas dinner for 8 we have dinner for 4. And this is STK. it's not like they are large portions. Imagine 4 filet mignons to be split with 8 people and basically enough asparagus for everyone to have 1.5 pieces and about one small scoop of Mac n cheese. That was all we had for Christmas dinner. 

I called that day to explain and was told that the manager would call me first thing in the AM to rectify the situation. Well...I got no call. Instead I called them twice. Didn't get a manager to call me back until late that day (only because I kept calling). At that point I was told that they were going to refund me for the portion that I did not receive. Sorry but that is not good enough. You guys ruined my family's Christmas dinner. We were all still incredibly hungry after and it was Christmas Day and we were in the middle of the woods so nowhere to get food. Also the lack of responsiveness and my having to track someone down is unacceptable. In my last conversation with someone I expressed my feelings on this. If I COULD have returned all of it for a full refund I would have but they left us in an impossible situation. Nobody would choose to pay half for half a Christmas dinner. Nobody. It should be a NO BRAINER that we are refunded for what they didn't provide, but there should be some other means of rectifying the situation in addition to compensate for the MORE THAN INCONVENIENCE that they put on our family. Simply refunding me for what I paid for and they did not provide is literally THE BARE MINIMUM. If you are going to do holiday dinners, you need to get them right or you ruin someone's holiday. 

I am so incredibly disappointed because STK has long been my husband and my date night spot. I am not sure we can continue to give our business to a restaurant that is so flippant about bad service...and to the point that even that managers have to be almost harassed to get a call back. I expect that kind of service from...Outback steakhouse or Longhorn, but NOT STK.",2020-12-27 19:03:42

The food or menu items had some hits and some misses. I loved the fried lobster tail appetizer! This is a seasonal item but it was good, crisp bite sized pieces of lobster meat, nicely breaded, grilled lemon garnish, on top of what seemed to be an avocado pur√©e  it was really good. 

My entree -Shrimp Scampi- (I don't recommend) It was bland and lacked flavor. It was a chore to eat it, but the kicker was a small piece of what seemed to be plastic was in my food so they offered to exchange my meal. I then switched my order to the braised beef short ribs, they were good ( nice and tender) but by the time I received them it was pretty late into the dinner and the new set of silverware brought out didn't appear very clean, just things you don't expect at a ""nice restaurant"".
 
For me the food was average, considering the price point. The atmosphere was nice, the music was REALLY good, a bit on the loud side but since we were celebrating, it was fun and lively for us. I enjoyed the atmosphere.

There were just a few small issues with our order. We ordered through Uber Eats and the food arrived promptly and fresh in a big, sturdy box. 

We ordered the mixed family pack which was supposed to be 4pcs of dark meat and 8 tenders with 8 biscuits and two family sides. We got the dirty rice and hash browns for our sides. The meal also comes with a half gallon beverage, so we ordered the unsweetened iced tea. 

The tenders and biscuits were excellent. Everything was seasoned well, and the biscuits were buttery and perfectly fluffy as usual. We tried to call in to tell them to add some butter and honey to our order for the biscuits, but there seemed to have been some communication issues on the phone and at the store, as the condiments never did show up. 

For the rest of the chicken, there was a mix up as we didn't get the full dark meat set that my fianc√© wanted, but instead got the original set comprised of a breast, wing, thigh, and drum. He still enjoyed it, but I did notice the skin was also kind of soggy and could've been fried harder. 

The hash browns were cooked perfectly as always...The dirty rice had good flavor again. I think it reminds of Denny's rice pilaf that they used to serve. (Not sure if they still do or not). I know that's nothing special, but I think I like it for the nostalgic aspect. Although, the rice got a little cold from being put right next to the iced tea.

The tea itself was really good, but unfortunately it was not the unsweetened one we ordered. I love sweet tea, but if you're trying to watch your sugar, then obviously this becomes a problem. 

So overall, 4 stars for the food but 3 stars for the mix-ups. It's only my first time ordering from this location and I do understand how things can appear a little confusing on the Uber Eats app, but sometimes it does just come down to attention to detail too. I would probably not order from this location again, as the Duluth and Lawrenceville locations provided better service.

We just ordered from this Bojangles for the first time last month and gave them the benefit of the doubt, even though there were problems and inaccuracies initially. Today was more of the same. They made the same mistakes as last time and actually provided worse service by forgetting items altogether. 

I understand that the Uber Eats platform is still probably partly to blame as the listing of substitutions can be confusing, but more attention to detail would really help. We incorrectly received the sweet tea instead of unsweetened again, and they missed the note for ""all dark meat"" for our combo box with tenders again. Additionally, they didn't remember any of our biscuits. We did not receive one biscuit with our combo meal, and it's one of the main reasons my fianc√© wanted Bojangles today. Luckily, Uber Eats refunded us for the wrong order, but I'm disappointed as this second chance went south. 

As far as trying new items goes, the dessert biscuits with extra icing were both really great. We would get those again. The mac and cheese we ordered was okay. It's nothing phenomenal and tastes exactly the same as KFC, Church's, and Safeway grocery store mac, but it's a solid, comfortable side with nothing wrong about it. 

Safe to say we will be sticking to the Duluth and Lawrenceville locations for Bojangles next time where service still seems to be more consistent.",2020-07-18 21:28:31

1. Reservations made for 9pm. We arrived and were told they were backed up so there would be a wait. That was a whole lie- the restaurant was practically empty. Now, I understand wanting to create demand/interest, making your establishment appear busier than it is by having patrons sit/stand out in the front making you appear busier than you are. Honestly, NBD I get it so I wasn't going to make this an issue but when you layer this on to the rest  of this experience, I just can't accept it. We were finally seated 20 mins after our reservation time AND after parties (of the same size) that arrived AFTER us were seated. 

2. After being seated we waited at least 15 mins before our waiter came by to take our drink orders. He took our order for drinks and we waited another 15 mins for those drinks to show up at which point he took our order. 

3. The market ""fish"" was actually shellfish (annoyed)- I ordered the Salmon and Brussels. He quickly tells me they have run out of Brussels- ok, I'll choose something else. All seems well after he takes our order except he comes back a few minutes later to tell me they are out of Salmon. There's no other seafood on the menu other than raw bar items- he suggest raw bar king crab and tells me he'll have the kitchen steam it since I don't want raw seafood. We really should've just left at this point, but it's my birthday and I figured- hey it'll be good- It's ok. 

4. WRONG! Cold crab arrives at my table. My husband, who order a filet mignon topped with shrimp gets his steak bare (no shrimp no sauce- just a big white plate with a slab of meat taking up maybe a quarter of the plate) The food runner states, the shrimp and sauce are coming soon. Seriously?! It's a steak topper!!!! Shrimp arrives about 10 mins after our meal. 

No apologies, no nothing. The food was cold and subpar at best. I seriously could've had a better meal for half the price at Ted Montana's. No shade to Ted's but, put that into perspective to help highlight how poorly the food was executed, and top that with unacceptable service. This restaurant touts  itself as a premium establishment- the food and service should compliment it, and it fell incredibly short.

We won't come back to this restaurant.",2019-09-02 03:19:33

I called for a reservation on the day of and was given a 7:00 pm time.  We arrived and were greeted promptly.  The restaurant has seating towards the front and in the rear.  They took us to the rear of the restaurant (all booth seating).  If you're a party of more than two you have a huge booths. For a party of two it's kind of awkward and not very intimate.  You're literally sitting facing anyone and everyone that walks by.... it lacks privacy. So we asked to move to the front where the seating was more traditional.  

I didn't take off a star for that because the food was delicious and that's what we came for...

First let me start out by saying the food was good. I order the roasted chicken with a side of jalape√±o grits and Mac n cheese. Ok on to the review the venue is nice dimmed lights, nice music,  God atmosphere. I was invited by my friend from college for his 25th bday celebration. So first let me say my friends had to make 2 separate reservations because the person who answered the phone said 23 was too much. So they made 2 reservations in hopes to sit together.. They quoted us $2500 to get a private area to accommodate everyone... In my mind I'm thinking money is money you're going to get paid regardless if the group is together or separate and being that my friends family was in charge it was going to be a big tip for the lucky waiter or waitress... But anyway His girlfriend planned it all so it was mostly family and friends totally 23 people.. We arrived at 6:30 to find that they could not accommodate 23 people and wanted us to split up our party.. Finally after my friends girlfriend talked to a member of management they were able to give us the area to the right as soon as you walked in. The waiter was great real energetic and tries his best to cut the tension.. So it's a birthday and of course you take pictures. A worker came and told my friends cousin ""I'm sorry but you can't take pictures in here with a flash die to our arts work"" and also ""we don't want to disturb our guest with the flash"" I understand the flash thing but the art work.. Really... Mind you there was probably only 2 couples in the restaurant on a Saturday night at 6:30... Pretty slow. So the photos stopped. Next the waiter put in the orders and a lot of people order the Mac n cheese but never got it. In fact 2 People never received theirs and I was one of them.. You'll notice in my pictures that you will only see the grits and chicken because I told them to just put the Mac n cheese in a to go box due to it taking so long to receive... So finally everyone at and here comes the bill. The waiter comes out and says ""the manager has requested that we limit credit card usage to 3 cards per table"" (what the heck). So my friends family then has to gather cash tally up everyone's dishes plus tax and the added gratuity that was in the total.. You would think the waiter would do the pleasure of breaking everyone's orders down for us but that was not the case at all. Finally we got all the monies divided up and were able to check out.. And at the end I guess the valet left early or quit or something but all our cars were on the curve with the keys to be found no where.. Overall restaurant has a lot of potential and is in the heart of Atlanta, food was good, and venue is nice but we just had a bad experience.. Word to the wise don't go for a party and if you do don't have more than 5 people, bring cash just in case and be prepared for a long wait even if it's only 4 other people in the restaurant...",2015-11-09 22:44:59

She was very knowledgeable about the menu and was very involved in the ordering process. She recommended the mashed potatoes which were AMAZING and also gave a little history/about STK.  The food was top tier (compliments to the chef) but Martine definitely stole the show. I don't want to be waited on by anyone else.

First and foremost there host was the most rudest host ever, she literally had us stand in the rain for almost 30min even after I explained that my party was here and trying to find a parking space. She was rude about the situation when I asked could We wait at the bar because it's raining. I wish I could say that was it smh, but after we finally got seated we literally waited 20mins before our waitress came to our table. I know what most of you thinking it was probably busy right, smh nope they literally was all congregated at the bar talking amongst each other. When sh finally came to the table and took our order the drinks didn't show up for an additional 15min no exaggeration. Then our waitress disappeared again for another 10min before taking our order, so we literally been there for an hour before our order was took. I forgot to add this was my Anniversary, we were a party of 8 and honestly I doubt if this establishment EVER see my money again.

First of all, let me say the venue is really nice and we were greeted at the door very nicely, every staff  member was wearing their masks and overall the scenery was really nice . The location was really easy to find, The parking is located in the hotel lobby and STK validates.

Our server was really nice and inviting. So this is not a direct reflection on her. We were seated within 5 minutes of getting in the door and was given water prior to us being greeted by our waitress.  We decided against any appetizers and just ordered mimosas while we decided on what we would have to eat.  The waitress did really well in making sure that our glasses were full consistently with the bottomless mimosas. 

After awhile we finally decided and placed our orders. I had the steak and eggs , and my two friends had the pork belly and the eggs Benedict I believe. While we sat and laughed and talked about starting a new YouTube show centered around our excessive weekly brunches that we plan on starting , we watched as other people who sat after us received their meals.  At first we were like ""oh maybe they ordered appetizers "" only to see that they had entrees as well. 
( so , we were a little confused ) 

Finally, our server came by and judging by our faces she could tell that we were not the happiest. We asked about our orders and she advised she would go check on it. She came back with a round of mimosas and still didn't even mention what the status was.  So, we kept chatting and watching other people get their meals. We finally received our order and my friend who had the lobster Benedict food came out wrong,( the egg was poached instead of scrambled like he requested) I never received my steak sauce and all of our food was cold. At this point, I was starving so I just ate my food and so did my friend with the pork belly order , our other friend returned his meal to be corrected and still took forever to the point where he just cancelled. 

I think STK is a very nice establishment but for those prices , I would think the service would be a little bit better. To go out and spend almost 100$ or more for cold food that takes forever to come out is just not the ideal way of brunching or dining for that matter.",2021-01-18 00:26:28

The steak 14 or 16 oz Delmonico, Medium Rare.  Wasn't a perfect medium rare little closer to medium but close enough to pass.  Great seer to the outside and nice tender cut.  I'd give it about 3.5 out 5.

The sides were for the most part the star of the show.  Had cauliflower, Mac and cheese, truffle and Parmesan fries, and corn pudding.  I'd give the sides a 4.5 out of 5.

Server and service was excellent; very warm, knowledgeable, and kept the meal pace up nicely.

The atmosphere was very nice except for one little issue that did not appeal to me.  So, the interior was clean, good lighting and finally good music.  The issue was the music was so loud that it was hard to keep conversation.  Not to mention it was as if there was a subwoofer under our booth.  I mean seriously the booth was vibrating every time the bass hit!  So I'd rate it a 2 out 5

I love the decoration inside and how you can have a table in the dock containers. Food has small variations with names changed which really makes it nothing different than other places in the parks. They do this on purpose because of the wide variety of tastes in the large crowds. The best part was the decor other than that it's just an average food place.

We were seated right when it was our reservation time (8:45p.m)! It was very dark and intimate, they have glasses in between tables to social distance. They also play pretty lit musicc, it was loud but not too loud. 
We ordered an old fashion and honey maker. It was okay! They give you complimentary bread to start, which was amazing btw! That scallion butter or whatever it is, is phenomenal!!!! 
We share Dominico steak, mash potatoes, and the traditional Mac. The sides were so good! The steak as asked for medium well, it came out so rare it looked like it was still alive lol. We had to send it back, but it took forever to get our food. They give you a 90 minute limits but how can you if your food takes about an hour LOL.

I made the decision to have tacos and it was a great decision!

I wanted to try the burrito combo ($7) but opted for just 2 crispy beef burritos ($4).  Firstly, I'm not an expert on tacos by any means, but I do know what I like and I definitely liked this!

The crisp beef burritos were large and flavorful with a very generous amount of beef in each, well worth the $2 each!

From the moment we walked in, everything was first class. Although our party did not arrive all at once, the team of hostesses were so gracious and warming as we arrived. 

We began with a drink at the bar and couldn't believe the amount of wonderful signature drinks STK has to offer. Luke was our bartender and he made a wonderful lasting impression on us. He was a true southern gentlemen who provided first class service. He was extremely knowledgable when it came to all the drinks and made some excellent recommendations. Honestly, the cucumber stiletto was the best drink I have ever tasted in my life. Delicious and refreshing. As someone who has worked in the industry for the past 8 years, I appreciated Luke's level of service and personality as he truly knows how to meet and exceed a customers expectation and needs. 

As we all sat down to dinner, the vibe, energy, and overall atmosphere was trendy, sexy, and truly ""not your daddy's steakhouse"" as they call themselves. Jarrett was our server and was also exceptional. Amazing service from beginning till end. We never waited for a drink and was always on top of things. I had the bone in filet, which was absolutely outstanding. Hands down the best steak I have ever add, especially with the peppercorn rub and STK bold sauce on the side. D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! 

STK is an excellent midtown spot for drinks, food, and an overall great night out.

We were closer to the entrance, more ideal for talking.  But they said big groups sit on the other side where the music seemed louder and it was even prettier over there.  Would be a great place to have a group party with your well-to-do friends (look at that price tag!).

(2 steps:  buy the pass book on Groupon, then go to the company's website and put in your purchase code & it will be mailed for another $3).  Back to the review...I am not a big steak or meat person, so I only ordered the Lobster Ravioli.  It had veggies in it or something, so I didn't like it and sent it back.  I liked their mashed potatoes though.  The men liked the macaroni, but I'm very picky about mac, so it wasn't for me.  There were potato wedges that our friend said he always gets, but they were ok to me.  My friend had one of the specials:  filet mignon with peppercorns, lobster, shrimp, and oscar (asparagus and sauce)...the price all a la carte!  But I would definitely get a filet with peppercorns and oscar next time (and the mashed potatoes).  My man had a Cowgirl steak, but he said the Cowboy steak at Stoney River is much better.  We kept asking for bread, which we finally got after we finished our meal.  They were hot and buttered, but either I was too full or they were just rolls to me.  The only thing that I was a little miffed about was (in the restaurant, there was a sign for Valet $3), the valet dude said it was $10.

This place needed on revamp on decor. The place looked like a barn on the inside with chairs and tables from the 1990's all around the location. I heard people yelling across the restaurant at waiters that they had waited 15 minutes for food. We should have gotten out of there when we heard this.

Customer service lacked with the front counter and dining room being void apart from 2 waiters and a cashier who was ignoring her duties and playing games on her phone. The cashier also put in the completely wrong order from what we got. We had to send the food back once and get a new order. We saw the cashier take the tray and throw it away walking into the kitchen to tell the chefs what to cook.

""Food isn't even ready to be made""
""Your systems isn't working properly to change shifts""

I dined here for a late dinner after riding smugglers run. This is a quick service spot where you wait to order and then wait for your food to come out at the counter. 
Of course everything is extremely themed here. You pay ""credits"" and head to the counter where your food slowly runs down a conveyor belt to the cast member who hands you your tray. Futuristic! 
There is ample seating inside and even some really neat seating outside. We opted for outside because it was a nice evening and it was less crowded outside. Even the sliding doors are themed to make you feel like you're really on another planet. 
I ordered the Felucian Garden Spread. Overall this a great meal and a good vegan option, but it sat in my stomach a little weird (maybe because I had a blue milk before dinner?). The dish was really flavorful, but maybe a bit too heavy on the garlic.

I am not a vegetarian but my SO is, so probably 80% of my diet is vegetarian. I'm pretty comfortable with vegetarian and vegan staples. Unfortunately, I would not want to eat here again. It felt like every negative NYC food stereotype wrapped into one restaurant. There's $10 juice. A single bottle of juice. $10. But don't worry if that $10 juice is too expensive, you can buy a 2oz shooter of this miracle juice for $4.

I was not really impressed with the atmosphere or food here. The cupcake tasted exactly like a hostess cupcake, except with less cream filling, which made me just wonder why I spent $4 on a less tasty copycat of a $.99 snack. The fries were soggy and limp. The beet ketchup was surprisingly tasty though. The basic burger was decent, I really liked all the pickles on it. The guac burger was dry and flavorless and so was the bun. If it wasn't 99% guacamole it would barely be edible. At least the guac was great!

The atmosphere here was atrocious. It's backstabbing murderously vicious to get a table. There's no organization to it at all, you just run back and forth through the restaurant trying to beat everyone else to a table, while mobbing the diners trying to put their coats on.

Okay so you want to know what this intriguing food is all about. Its regular american food...just repackaged to look completely different. The ribs are cut so the bones go the opposite direction you would expect. The chicken breast it cut into a perfect rectangle.  The veggies are chosen for their color. For instance, it's not just cauliflower....its orange or green cauliflower. Cabbage is purple not green. It's just different enough to give the buy-in that you are really on Batuu.
Flavors? Like everything at Disney, average is not in their dictionary. The flavor is upscale, sit-down, table service level.  Its above hamburger and hot dog fare...skip Andy's lunchbox and come here!

I believe they will go back to $7 after the holidays. My coworker and I  shared an order of steak frites ($16) with chipotle aioli and ketchup. The frites were so hot, fresh, and crispy. The chipotle aioli was also a nice addition for dipping the frites. At dinner time, they also offer complimentary bread covered lightly with bleu cheese butter and served with chive oil for dipping. You can get full just off of the bread. It's just that good! Since my coworker's birthday is on Tuesday, we got an early start and kicked it off with some birthday shots!

Besides that, inside is a bit tiny, the mirrors give the feel of much bigger area but it does look romantic, I give it that feel, however if I'm there on a date, I don't want to be looking into someone else's booth while there on a date and I'm on a date, it's just weird.

I'll never go back there to think about it. To celebrate bday festivities and to go in here with to expect the best out of Atlanta I was sadly mistaken, our waiter and the complimentary drink was a great feel, I can't give Casey enough prays....really cool and informative..if the food matched up to the staff then I would be like I'll return every time no questions asked...Being from Boston and being in Miami less than a month ago I was looking for the best of the best when it came to the seafood and sad to say, STK is no where on that radar, let alone the Prices are install for the food you get. If it wasn't a special occasion, I certainly would have went everywhere else but here.

I thought to myself how hard it must be working to keep up with the pace. Upon ordering a drink the bartender asked if I wanted bread to which I responded yes. after about 10 minutes I watched one of the other employees from behind the bar bring bread out but, only he gave it to the couple sitting next to me. I thought well surely mine must be coming as well. The bread never came and there was no apology or acknowledgment that I never received it or perhaps that my bread was given to the couple next to me because they had already had their entr√©e.

Don't get me wrong, the shakes are deliciously thick (although I am not a fan of their chocolate syrup, which is sad) and their burgers have that yummy grilled taste. But let's be real, no one would be waiting in line if the Cook-Out Tray combo meal totaled $10 instead of like, $5. 

Pro: There is an absurd amount of milkshake options. As I said earlier, the chocolate-based ones had sort of been a disappointment. The Cheerwine float, however, is legit. 

Con: Many of the sides are straight out of your high school cafeteria. The chicken nuggets, corndogs, and slaw take me right back to 1999 and the grassy area outside Senior Hall, as my friends and I talked and ate and sang along when someone blared out K-Ci and JoJo's ""All My Life"" through a contraband stereo. 

Pro/Con: The line moves pretty quickly. But a line is a line and if you're starving, it will seem like forever. 

Damn. Now I want some Cook-Out.",2015-01-07 15:41:53

We had not hung out in over a year due to the pandemic and really wanted to make it something fancy. I did some research and saw STK had great ratings and the food looked really good. They were also practicing social distancing within the restaurant which was also a plus. I made the reservations a week in advance to avoid any trouble when we arrived but once we got there there was still a 45 minute wait which was annoying but we still decided to wait. I got my text when the table was ready and upon arriving inside there was a DJ playing which I didn't expect. This was our first visit so we rolled with it. It really gave me club vibes which I'm not a fan of. It was dark inside with minimal lighting that barely allowed us to view the menu without using our flashlights on our phones. I was looking for a place that had a different setup so we could talk and play catch-up. This was not that. We were seated at a small table in the corner of the restaurant near the entrance. It was again not what I was expecting. The prices are ridiculous for the quality of food we received. We started with the $23 calamari which arrived on a dinner plate that was barely full. It was just ok, took forever to receive but was disappointed at the portion size for the price. Our waitress was kind enough to send us a second order on the house after we expressed our feelings about the size. I could have eaten that one serving alone as we were both saving our appetites for this food all day. Our drinks were just as small and expensive for $16 each. For the entree my friend ordered the surf and turf with a filet and lobster tail. (Not pictured) the lobster tail had 0 flavor. No butter no herbs Old Bay or nothing. I have had better at Outback for less money. Her filet looked so sad and dry. No juices on the plate. She ordered the yukon gold mashed potatoes as a side which was also $16 for a small side. The potatoes had the most flavor out of everything received. My entree was the $49 Maine lobster linguini which is pictured below. This was pretty much a plate of linguini with lobster, cherry tomatoes and Ragu spaghetti sauce. As pleasing as it looked to the eyes it didn't translate to taste. It was one note flavor, no seasoning and could have used some fresh parmesan basil and red pepper flakes to make it taste like something. I literally ate a few bites and was ready for the check. I took the rest of the pasta home thinking I would jazz it up and add somethings to it but ended up throwing away $50 because it was hopeless. I also ordered a side of creamed spinach that was awful and watery and not at all what it should have tasted like. It tasted frozen. It was luke warm when it arrived and had again NO FLAVOR no cheese not even a creamy texture. I have absolutely done better in my own kitchen honestly. I sent it back. It was really a poor experience overall for us to have spent over $200 for such a meal. I felt bad for picking this place to go to when we could have just gone to Ruth's Chris for a better experience and saved has and money for parking. Epic failure.",2020-11-08 13:35:58

Over time, Disney has definitely improved their quick-service offerings, and this place does not stray far from that new model. It serves as a great addition to the Walt Disney World Resort and especially to Disney's Hollywood Studios, whose quick-service offerings 5 years ago were limited mostly to traditional theme park fare (albeit at higher quality).

Disney's new quick-service model seems to be to deliver unique menu offerings using quality ingredients at fair prices in creative environments. Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo satisfies all the above. For breakfast in particular, the menu offerings include Tugg's Morning Oats (morning oats and mango smoothie), Bright Suns Morning (three-cheese egg bite, pork sausage, purple potato hash, and mini mustafar roll, the last of which is a cinnamon bun with some lemon-raspberry zest), and Mustafar Lava Roll (same as the mini version from Bright Suns Morning). Kids can get the Younglings version of Bright Suns Morning, and you'll also find various drink options. On this trip, I opted for the Bright Suns Morning and found it to be hearty, fresh, and savory. The eggs were surprisingly fresh (they look frozen, and very well may be, but certainly don't taste that way). The potato hash was perhaps the freshest ingredient, and the sausage was cooked perfectly (moist on the outside, slightly charred on the outside). And the Mustafar roll really took me by surprise! I never thought I'd like lemon and cinnamon together, but the balance of lemon, cinnamon and raspberry made for a pastry that was both sweet and refreshing.

Ambiance here is fun as well! You really feel like you're sitting in a docking bay that's been converted into a canteen. The eclectic music adds to the atmosphere, and the citizens of Batuu working here (the Cast Members) come around to each table to take your utensils and waste to the garbage for you. Speaking of which, this place also utilizes real dishes and silverware, reducing waste and providing a better quality dining experience.

Overall, I love this place for breakfast and will definitely try again for lunch/dinner on a future trip!",2019-10-16 18:03:50

And if you're looking for something that's not chicken nuggets but won't break the bank, you've found the right place. 

My dad got the plant based meatballs. It comes with hummus and pita and is a decent portion size. I thought it was a bit on the salty side; but what isn't salty at Disney? Not much. My mom and I both got the chicken tip yip kids meals. We never finish the adult size portion so this size was perfect for us. We were full after we ate the whole plate and it even came with a small drink. For $9.99, it's not bad for Disney prices.

Beautifully presented, this beauty is packed with flavors, like the richness of the tender beef juxtaposed to the creaminess and tartness of the horseradish and earthiness of the olives. Mix that all up and pile it on a large, crunchy banana chip and you got a complete array of textures. We can't get over how crunchy and hearty this dish turned out to be in the end. What better way to start your meal with a little bit of beef, and a cool sweet drink to complete it? With this course we sipped on the Strawberry Cobbler. A sweet and sassy pink drink that's one-part sweet and tart strawberry and one-part boozy vodka martini. Finish it off with a sweet and rich graham cracker crust rim and you have a dessert in a glass. Pinky up.



Something we can't stop thinking about is the second course dish, the sea bass. A fantastic and flaky, melt-in-your-mouth piece of decadence simply seasoned with salt, pepper, and dusted with butter. Even thought it is simply done, it is perfection. Just image that perfectly done fish on top of a fava bean puree mixed with fava beans, snap peas, and butter. It was soft, light, buttery, earthy, and crunchy. It had the gamut of flavors and knocked our socks off. Mark our words, this is one of the best fish dishes in Atlanta. For best bite, mix all the dish ingredients together. With our sea bass, we opted for the Shake Your Honey Maker cocktail. Their take on the tiki cocktail with a blend of pineapple, rum, honey, and vanilla. This was my (Liz's) favorite cocktail because it reminded me of a cool beach day, sitting under an umbrella, watching the ocean waves crash on the beach. It was the beach in a glass. Don't forget to get some of the sugar rim for something a little sweeter!



Have you ever had an experience that went down as one of the best of your lives? Enter the Tomahawk Steak with truffle and butter. Brought to the table plain, the butter is slathered on top and then the truffle is sliced FRESH right in front of you and layered on top of the steak. Beyond the top-notch presentation, it comes with all-out decadent sides and so many sauces, you almost have an endless combination of flavors to choose! Starting with the steak itself, tender and medium temperature, it has everything you'd imagine in a perfect steak with that meaty burst up front and a slight char on the back. Topped with the butter and truffle, you get a ton of creaminess up front, but the truffle comes in and mellows it into an earthy, creamy, meaty bite. You really don't need ANY sauce for this gorgeous piece of meat, but if you do you can mix and match to find your favorite combination. With the butter and the truffle, we found that you can brighten up the bite with the chimichurri sauce or turn up the richness with the au poivre. If some tartness is what you're looking for to pair with the butter and earthiness of the truffle and butter, why not MIX both the STK sauce and the STK sauce with sriracha? No matter what you pick, you're in for a real treat. Perfection on a plate.

You can't go to a steak house and not get an array of fabulous sides that are beyond good. From the truffle mac n cheese to the jalapeno cheese grits and the newest side, egg-in-a-hole, you're taste buds are in for a roller coaster! The best of the three was the truffle mac n cheese, which was so rich, deep, cheesy, creamy, and earthy, there's no way to you're NOT finish that whole thing. It's one of those sides you can't stop eating. They also offer bacon, lobster, and other flavors to top on there, but for just the base mac n cheese it's one of the best we've ever had, EVER. The jalapeno cheese grits were the perfect blend of out-of-control cheesy to slightly spicy. Plus, the egg-in-a-hole was a fun, different side with a runny egg that created a sauce over the succulent mushrooms. Which side would you choose?  Put us down for some more mac n cheese, please.

Of all the desserts, the chocolate cake and the cookie sundae stood out. Being a decadent dessert lover, we both really enjoyed the chocolate cake. It was an explosion of rich, dark chocolate with tender cake. More: https://adventuresinatlanta.com/stk-atlanta/",2020-09-05 20:22:57

In the past I have received the wrong food and had normal issues like long wait time and cold food. This time I went to the DQ at 3:30pm on a Sunday in need of a quick snack and dreaming of the $5 chicken strip basket with a drink and small peanut butter sundae. Unfortunately the employee told me they only do 5 buck lunches on weekdays. I had previously gotten the special on weekends. In fact it used to be a tradition to stop there on my way back from Winco on Sundays because I don't like cooking after grocery shopping. Ridiculous, I know. 
Anyways, I was surprised to hear that news and the employee seemed pretty confident. As I was waiting for my food I quickly searched online and found that the DQ website for this location states that they have the 5 and 6 buck lunches all 7 days. I planned to show the employee and see if I could get money back but a different employee quickly gave me my food and rushed back.

Classic example - he asks only 2 of us if we wanted the seafood platter and says okay I'll order a couple of platters for the whole table and walks away. I tried to grab his attention so that he could slow down and let us know what was happening. To my horror, he placed an order for 10 people at $42 per person. Just for the appetizer, not even getting the entire table's consent. This behavior was just foreign to me. When we asked for additional bread, he informs us it's an additional $5 per loaf. We agreed to get two, and he brought 3. Again, always appearing for snipets of time and not allowing us anytime to process what he was asking us. Anyways when it comes time to order the entrees, he makes recommendations about adding some shrimp to the steak which some agreed to, but he left it at his own discretion to decide the number of shrimp to add on each plate, and at $8 per shrimp, it would have at least been courtesy to explain how ""some shrimp"" are defined in the kitchen.

I live a block away from this location. I was so excited to see that there was a Rally's opening so close to my home. It was nice to see some variety moving into the area. I went there for a couple months, and I have never returned. Sorry, that's not true. I tried to give them another shot recently, but it failed once again. (I'll get to that soon).

Let's start with the drive-thru... Every time I have used the drive-thru, it has taken anywhere from 30 mins to over 45 mins!! That is not what you call fast food!! I have actually had to wait over one hour to get my food. That is the biggest reason I quit going to this location.

Accuracy, not a Rally's Tradition... Probably 80% of the time I have gone through the drive-thru, my order has been incorrect.... AFTER waiting 30+ minutes in line. Somehow, these children can mess up a simple fast food order. They actually get an order that says to add or subtract items on a sandwich, but they can't even get that right. We have all said it before... It's not rocket science!!

Something Is Always Broke Down.... I don't know if you've ever tried to order ice cream from this place, but it seems to be that the ice cream machine is ALWAYS down for some reason. Which to be honest with you, is a complete LIE!!! They are basically lying to their customers. The children that they hire just don't want to clean the machines. Or, they don't know how to operate them correctly.

Is there anyway you can ignore me even more??... I understand that Fast Food relies on young people as their employees. However, when your staff is extremely rude and completely ignores people... You fire them!! That is just Retail 101. I don't know who owns this particular Rally's, but they obviously do not care about the community or their customers!! I am hoping to see them fail completely, and a better owned business replace them. I don't appreciate working all day, going through a drive-thru, and having a snotty little teenager give me attitude!! And that is all you will get at this location, attitude... when THEY F-up!!! The employees are Incompetent & Rude!! They are basically children.

One more chance.... Just the other week we couldn't figure out what to do for dinner. So, we thought we would walk up to Rally's and order at the walk-up window. Thought it would be quick and simple.  WE WERE WRONG!!! There were about 6 cars in line at the drive-thru, but nobody at the walk-up. After standing there for 20 minutes... And not one person coming to the window... We decided to go across the street to Kroger and buy frozen dinners!! At least that way, we knew we would get food quickly and it would be accurate.

All-in-All.... I would avoid this place. Unless you enjoy long lines, LONG wait times, inaccuracy and SNOTTY LITTLE CHILDREN!! Or, see for yourself. I will NEVER return to this Rally's, and do my best to get them booted from Whitehall!!

C.  Burgers:  Cool-the Guac had a differennt burger than the regular-that is awesome.  However, combining corn salsa with the guacamole seems like a bad idea. 
D.  Macaroni and cheese;  great.  But I would use a bit more salt, and cheese flavor (I assume from brewers yeast), and perhaps mustard for a bite.  My daughter is a mushroom hater but loved the shitake bacon.  9 out of 10,
E.  Chicken/tempeh tenders:  More salt.  Good amount of sage.  More pepper.  Nice and crispy.  The ""aoli""-too sweet.  Needs more savory flavors.  Barbecue sauce, tasty, but also too sweet.

I ordered the Wagu Steak with King Crab, Mac and Cheese and Corn Pudding. Due to my order taking so long they ended up having to box my food to go. I asked my waitress why it took so long as a member of the party arrived 20 min after me, placed her order and finished her meal before mine came out via to go containers and they said the kitchen was backed up. I didn't even complain. I then have to go to the rest room at the end of the dinner. So I leave my food bagged up in the chair. After returning from the bathroom my food, that I haven't touched is no where to be found. My waitstaff then informs me that he gave my food to a member of the 12 person party. After checking with everyone no one has it. I called the night of the event, as well as the next day. I believe the managers name is David has yet to get back to me.

We visited this one on Buford Highway OTP in Doraville this past Monday for Buford Highway UYE #116: https://www.yelp.com/events/doraville-buford-highway-uye-bojangles-famous-chicken-n-biscuits. At this location, I experienced some of the slowest fast food service in my 38+ years on this earth.

This is Bojangles' store #987 and it's located across the street from White Windmill Bakery & Cafe. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the dining room was still closed with signs posted on the locked door. It was drive-thru service only. In contrast, it looked like just another ""normal"" pre-pandemic day at White Windmill with a full parking lot and customers seated inside. This is a microcosm of what America looks like today, in June 2020: a disorganized and misleading patchwork of openings and restrictions.

I ordered a 12-piece box, but there was a miscommunication at the speaker. Bojangles' offers two kinds of 12-piece boxes, the ""Super Tailgate"" and the regular. I ended up ordering a regular ($19.99), but it turned into a Super Tailgate (regular price $28.99). Both boxes come with 12 pieces of fried chicken and six biscuits, but only the Super Tailgate comes with three ""picnic fixins"" (large sides) and a half-gallon of sweet tea.

I ended up getting rung up for a regular box when I wanted a Super Tailgate. After paying and explaining what I really wanted, the cashier let me place an additional order for a la carte picnic fixins at the window (I didn't have to drive back around; that was nice of her). Picnic fixins are priced at $3.19 each. I ordered mac 'n cheese, coleslaw, and green beans. I ended up getting mac 'n cheese, coleslaw, and *baked* beans even though the receipt said green beans. SMH.

Not only that, but at the speaker, I was told they were out of thighs. They said it would be a 15-minute wait for thighs which we were OK with. After paying, we were instructed to wait in the ""first"" parking spot. That 15-minute wait actually turned out to be over 30 minutes. Our receipts were time-stamped 5:58 PM and 5:59 PM and we didn't get our food until after 6:30 PM.

They also messed up our order twice (three times if you count ringing us up for a regular 12-piece box instead of a Super Tailgate 12-piece box). First was the aforementioned baked beans. We should've gotten green beans. Second, we also ordered a Cajun Filet Biscuit with Pimento Cheese. It's a special limited time menu item for $4.18, sandwich only. They completely forgot about it. After delivering the box to my car, we checked its contents and noticed the Cajun Filet Biscuit with Pimento Cheese was missing. I had to go back to the store and wait outside the locked door until the cashier came back out. I told her what we were missing. Apparently, the biscuit was already packed in a bag, ready to go, and they just missed it.

By the way, we were just one of several cars who had to drive away from the window after paying and wait for our order.

Needless to say, while the cashier was polite enough, service was terrible. No wonder why this particular Bojangles' location has a low Yelp rating. It had a two-star average with 27 reviews before my post.

As for the food itself, it was OK. My wife really enjoyed the Cajun Filet Biscuit with Pimento Cheese, but I didn't. I took two, three bites and I was done. She had no problem finishing it though. The filet was nice and big, but the pimento cheese was too sharp for me, and I didn't like how the top half of the biscuit was much smaller than the base and crumbled apart so easily.

The chicken box is fine/good. We got breasts, drumsticks, and thighs. We had KFC recently for the first time in a long time so we could make a pretty decent direct comparison. I thought the enjoyment level of the chicken was equal, but my wife thought Bojangles' was much tastier than KFC, especially in terms of seasoning. I will say Bojangles' has substantially more generous portions than KFC. The pieces of KFC chicken are small, but maybe that's because Bojangles' chickens are shot up with hormones and steroids (I'm not sure). Bojanges' chicken batter is crispy, crunchy, and munchy.

On day three, we're still working our way through the box. The sides are alright. The coleslaw, by far, is the best side. Crisp, appetizing. I should've ordered two. The mac 'n cheese, eh. My wife says it reminds her of Velveeta mac and cheese (cheap). The baked beans, average/not bad. The sweet tea, good. Sweet, but not too sweet. Ideal for my tastebuds; your mileage may vary. The biscuits, A-OK. Buttered, flaky enough, but also as mentioned in my description of the Cajun Filet Biscuit with Pimento Cheese above, a bit too crumbly.

They should have included eating utensils and napkins in the box, but they did not.

TL;DR - The food at this Bojangles' location is par for the course, but the service is like scoring worse than triple bogey (bad). They really need to improve the service here.",2020-06-03 13:33:06

Made reservations for 6:30 and the restaurant was not crowded.  The hostess was very friendly and we were quickly seated.  

* The seating for two is so weird. Really uncomfortable semi-circle seat with a round table. Can't seat tall people there or their knees are going to be touching. 

* Our server was BUSY. He had too many tables to handle at one time.  He was running from the bar to tables and clearly needed some help. While telling us the evening specials he kept looking at another table calculating in his head what they needed. It would've been nice to get an attentive waiter since we are spending STK money. He also mixed up our wine order; couldn't tell which white wine was which. Service was not so great!! You get better service at Chick-fil-a. 

* For starters we ordered the Crispy Rock Shrimp and the Blackened Sea Scallops. The appetizers were the best part of the night. The Crispy Rock Shrimp are fried and sit on top of a bed of a sauce similar to the Bonefish Bang Bang Shrimp sauce.  They were really good. The scallops were nicely cooked and tasted great with the gigantic beans. Two really great appetizers.  They also provide complimentary bread that is really good!!! 

* For dinner we ordered the Bone-In Ribeye (cooked medium well) with 5 shrimp and the Carolina Trout with mashed potatoes and spinach for sides.  The Bone-In Ribeye was pretty good. Not worth $48.  But it was a decent steak.  Definitely not work $48.  The shrimp on top were SALTY!!! The chef for the night was heavy handed with the salt!!! The shrimp were inedible, but looked nice for presentation purposes only.  The Carolina Trout was average. The brussel sprouts on top were better than the actual fish. The trout, like the shrimp, was salty!!! The brussel sprouts with the hint of bacon on top of the trout were REALLY GOOD!!! That could've been a meal. The mashed potatoes honestly reminded me of instant mashed. They weren't bad...but I don't want instant mashed potatoes when I go to STK.  The spinach however was good in comparison to the mashed potatoes (if that says anything).

* The waiter put the dessert menu on the table and walked away. Not sure if he was supposed to tell us about the desserts or not, but he just walked away.

That is the best explanation I can come up with to explain the crowds.  I've been to many a Cook-Out, many a time, but I've never seen anything quite like this.  We are talking wrapped around the building, out the door slammed.  Late night Cook-Out runs are one of my fondest memories of college.  Honestly I would ask their peanut butter fudge milkshake to be a bridesmaid one day if it were socially acceptable, but man this Cook-Out is cray.

All that said, Cook-Out is well worth the wait and then some.  It is to the Atlanta fast food scene what everyone's favorite Antico is to pizza.  The hotdog, Cook-Out style, is uh-maze-ing.  Seasoned fries, hush puppies, or a quesadilla for a side?  Don't mind if I do!  Perhaps you fancy a burger with coleslaw or a barbeque sandwich instead?  Also an option!  It's open until 4:00 AM and the amount of food you get here for dirt cheap is not even funny.  The best part though - 40 flavors of handspun milkshakes!  Aside from Cook-Out, I don't think I've had a milkshake anywhere else in at least 20 years.  I don't really even like milkshakes, but the milkshakes at Cook-Out are out of this world good, especially the peanut butter fudge.  I will admit that I have strayed once or twice to the mint Oreo, peanut butter banana, and eggnog, but every time I realize my sin and go back to old faithful, my beloved Cook-Out peanut butter fudge milkshake.  

For those who are lucky enough to have experienced Cook-Out before, it's not the standard two drive-thru lines, possibly an old Checkers setup that you're used to.  You can in fact eat at the Moreland location (along with all of the new classier Cook-Outs built lately), but I'm a creature of habit and stick to drive-thru.  It's completely out of the way for me, but that is not going to stop me from being a regular.  Next up:  Cook-Out to go and a movie at Starlight Drive-In.

I am very disappointed at the experiences based on expectations. This review is for the brunch. Parking is available in the parking garage on 12th street I believe with validation. When we walked into the place there was no one to greet my friends and I. We stood at the front waiting and wondering what we needed to do for about 3-5 minutes. Once he came to the front we were seated. I like that they have glass partitions between booths. 

Our waitress was nice, however, I think that maybe she had too many ppl because I feel like our table was little neglected. It took an extremely  long amount of time( over an hour) for the food to come out for 3 people. We placed our order before a couple of tables and they received their food significantly sooner than ours.  We inquired with our waitress and she didn't follow up until it was finally coming out. One of my friends dish didn't come out as requested so it was sent back. 

I ordered the smoked pork belly benedict. It was awkward getting our food and one was not correct. Even with saying that my food was warm to cold range. The flavors were there and tasted good however it was hard to cut and because the muffin was a little over cooked. The pork belly had a lot of fat but the flavor was there as expected with pork. The hollandaise sauce was good as well but it was kind of cool so it was stiff. 

I also ordered drinks. The bottomless mimosas were closer to just orange juice but given the night I had before I didn't complain. Lol i supplemented the mimosas with an old fashion and it was decent but I didn't have an orange peel. It wasn't the best but it was good.

I ordered the spicy chicken burrito with the spicy chicken taco. The kid ordered kid taco. Both were underwhelming. The chicken was rubbery and was not spicy - tasted processed. The burrito was filled with flavorless white rice and beans - unimpressive. The taco was the same. The best part of the order was the ground beef taco the kid ordered.

This in mind, Extreme Pita is little pocket of pleasure. Is that too sexual? Don't care; it's my review. Wrap flavors range from Mediterranean to the Middle East to Backyard BBQ - stick with the veggie and sauce forward fold-ups, simply because you can't call something a Philly Cheese Steak when it ain't even close. The Chicken Shawarma isn't fooling any folks crazy for kebab, but it's a light and tasty sandwich which at least resembles its namesake. (No, there are no standing rotisseries in the house; the meat is griddle-heated to order, though.) Had I known you could've hacked the wraps with their sauces, I totally would've opted for chipotle hummus in my shawarma. Live and learn.

Each option has a small, regular and EXTREME portion, and all menu items feature calorie counts. The average sando is around 500 cals, and a side of their house baked garlic pita chips - a current Yelp check-in offer - are dry heat toasted and highly snackable. Pepsi products in the fountain; bottle bevs in the cooler. Cookies by Otis Spunkmeyer, the legend of Subway.

You can always find a coupon or active deal running with these guys.

We definitely felt comfortable as STK installed glass barriers to seperate each table following Covids new policies. 

The restaurant was pretty empty so our orders were taken pretty quickly. While our waiter was nice at first it seems as if something changed. When our food arrived she had no idea which meal was which and what belonged to us, we had to taste each sauce and literally cut the steak to see who ordered what. We then had asked for extra utensils and she took about 10 minutes to bring them as she claimed we were given enough; though we explained to her that a utensil set had fallen. While we were still eating she began to ask for our desert menu as if the restaurant had been closing. While I thought this behavior was strange as we were extremely nice to her it didn't change our experience.

Docking Bay 7 Food & Cargo Quick Service Restaurant is set in a multi-purpose transport shuttle that's docked on top of a large hangar. Inside, guests can find Tugg's Grub, a ""traveling diner for diners traveling"" which is run by Chef Strono ""Cookie"" Tuggs. His modified Sienar-Chall Utilipede Transport can be transformed into a mobile kitchen and restaurant, and he's set up base in the hangar for all the new travelers, gathering inspiration from his time on Takodana and ingredients from across the galaxy. Tuggs was there when Han Solo, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn landed on Takodana to see Maz Kanata, and after the events there, made his way to the Black Spire to set up his own restaurant. 

Smoked Kadu Pork Ribs include Sticky BBQ Pork Ribs, a Blueberry Corn Muffin, & Cabbage Slaw. The Kaadu ribs were incredibly tender and topped with some great seasoning! The blueberry cornbread paired well with the rest of the flavors in the dish, but the accompanying cabbage slaw was a bit bland and not the best side. 9/10

Shurabot Shrimp & Noodle Salad consisted of Vietnamese style Chilled Shrimp, Chilled Herb Marinated Noodles, Vegetables, and Cilantro. I didn't like that the dish was served cold and the herb sauce was a little too odd for my tastes. I hear the sauce for the kids meal version of this dish has less strong herbs and has a sweeter taste so I'd recommend trying the kids meal version over the adult version of this dish. 4/10 

Endorian Fried Chicken Tip Yip consisted of Crispy Chicken on top of Roasted Vegetable Potato Mash and an exotic looking green Herb Gravy. The chicken and mashed potatoes were pretty good but I could have used a different sauce than the provided green herb Gravy which tasted a little odd. Make sure to ask for this sauce on the side and see if the staff can offer any other alternative accompanying sauces. 6/10 

The Felucian Garden Spread includes falafel-like, plant-based meatballs with Herb Hummus, Tomato-Cucumber Relish, and Pitas. Surprisingly the plant-based meatballs are absolutely delicious. If you didn't know these were plant-based, you'd be surprised to find out these aren't made of meat. The combination of meatballs and Hummus is very filling and satisfying. 9/10 

Batuu Bon Dessert consists of Chocolate Cake, White Chocolate Mousse, and Coffee Custard with an exotic purple black and white cream topping and an exotic looking green sauce. Despite all the strange colors that might make you think the dessert was very fruity is was pretty chocolatey on the inside with the exception of the topping and was quite tasty. 8/10 

Oi-oi Puff Dessert consists of Raspberry Cream Puff, Passion Fruit Mousse, with an exotic looking white and green exterior with a blood red sauce. I'm not super into super fruity desserts so I didn't try this one.

Disney did a great job with making you feel like you're eating out of this world exotic foods without the foods being way too exotic for most people's flavor pallets. The theming of the restaurant as a cargo bay wouldn't be my first choice out of the many cool options in the Star Wars universe but I appreciate the level of detail Disney put into the place to give it an exotic vibe. The alien space fish hanging was a nice touch and the cargo containers allowed for a separated private space for large groups. There's plenty of patio seating outside as well. I would not rate this quick service restaurant as high as Satu'Li Canteen at Pandora in Animal Kingdom but I see many similarities in the theming and menu options although I like the food at Satu'Li Canteen better. However, this restaurant is probably one of the top dining options for Star Wars fans and one of the top dining options in Disney's Hollywood Studios Orlando!

Our server was an older black lady who had a ponytail with a side bang (I never caught her name) but she was an awful slow server. Out drinks came fast but the food took 2 hours! People who came to the restaurant 2 hours after us were eating in a matter of 30 minutes. We got bread after being there an hour and only brought 1 tray of bread for 8 ppl. Smh. Oh!! I haven't even got to the good part yet! 

So after 2 hours passed the food finally came out! At this point I was so hungry so I was ready to eat. The food looks good BUT TASTES HORRIBLY!!! The salmon tasted greasy, the lobster was so hard and stuck to the lobster shell I was so mad! The birthday girl and her best friend ordered steak and it was soooo tough and tasted horrible, her mom ordered lobster and asparagus and her lobster was tough to eat, tasted like burnt rubber, her brothers & her friend had the lobster pasta and while her young brother barely had any lobster in his pasta, her friend had most of it but they all said it was bland. I wanted to speak to the manager so bad but the waitress disappeared for a long period of time I was ready to go home. I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!!!

Not having been here in a while, I ordered some thing I was not happy with (accidentally) and she made it right! Would certainly come back. And ..... they now offer the Beyond Meat substitute.",2019-12-13 16:02:39

Surf and turf was very odd tasting the filet mignon had a unique pepper crusted something I don't know, did not enjoy it, lobster was very dry however they did take the order back and offer to exchange it and re-cook it so still a very nice place to try!",2020-07-03 18:56:14

We made reservations for 7:15 PM for my fianc√©'s birthday dinner for 2. We got seated right away, and I felt like my table was thisclose to the others. But the patrons next to us were also on dates, and they were super friendly. 

Make sure you bring your wallet, because drinks run about $15 a pop! I love the last margarita on this list. 

My steak was pretty good (small filet) but his steak (Strip Steak) was DELICIOUS! Seared perfectly. Each side is about $10, and enough for two people. We got mashed potatoes and asparagus, and we cleaned it out. 

I loved how our server brought out sparklers with two glasses of champagne AND two shots of the drink we had for us!!! Super nice touch. Usually they only bring for the birthday person at restaurants. Definitely a plus in my book. 

Our server was very attentive and I loved our experience. The music was also POPPIN!! I was rocking left to right all night! 

This is definitely the spot for birthday dinner, date night or when you want to impress someone for dinner. It made me feel like I was in a swanky NYC restaurant.",2019-10-14 18:37:08

Taco Luis developed a crazy cult following when I was a senior in high school (back in 2008). I was skeptical to try it at first because I hate being a conformist. But man, I gave in the moment I took my first bite of their beef burrito. 

Growing up, I lived on McDonald's and KFC, and never ever had Tex-Mex. In fact, I didn't know what ANY type of Mexican food tasted like. I think Taco Luis changed the fundamental nature of my food cravings, because apparently I love Taco Bell now? Oh, and the tater tots are crispy bites of heaven. The best thing is, it's soooo cheap (even though they've been increasing their prices).

One of the reasons this place is so well-liked is because the owner is extremely friendly, and has a ridiculously good memory. He remembered a lot of our faces and our usuals back in the day, and I bet he still does. He even has a Facebook group, for God's sake. I still visit Taco Luis every time I'm on break from college (and from the US in general), and I always walk away absolutely satisfied and nostalgic.",2011-07-27 10:45:47

I purchased a double burger, and the patties were so small there was a half inch of bun showing around them.The fries were cold, the onion rings burnt. At least the girl at the window was great.",2021-01-15 12:48:56
